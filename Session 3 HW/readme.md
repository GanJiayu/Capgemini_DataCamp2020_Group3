Session 3 Homework

To practice what we learnt today, for next session, youâ€™ll have to :

- [X] Apply LSI on your scraped data
- [X] Build a simple classification model using the embedding matrix and the rating of the review as target variable with a modern ML technique
- [X] Carry out the same analysis using FastText with the gensim package (optional)
- [X] Compare the performances of your models with the two or three type of embeddings:
    -- XGBoost + LSI/W2V/FT features
    -- MSE: Dummy(constant predictor) 1.34, LSI 1.34, W2V 0.70, FT 1.34
