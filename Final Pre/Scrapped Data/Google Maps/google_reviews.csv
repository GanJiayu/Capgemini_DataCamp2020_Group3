0,"Bokan is a 3 level rooftop bar, with a view over whole London, from the City. The atmosphere is relaxed and cheerful, there is live music and friendly service. The prices are very reasonable and it is just a perfect start for a Friday night! There is also an outside area where you can sunbath, and smoking is permitted there. There are also heaters to be able to enjoy it when it is cold. All in all, a fantastic place, perfect to start the weekend at!",5,a day ago
1,"Top floor bar with stunning views (even views from the bathroom's ceiling to floor windows!). I have been here numerous times. The drinks are a bit overpriced and the downside is, you are sort of made to sit at a table and get table service, and then get charged for table service. I would much prefer just being able to pick up my drink from the main bar. I have stayed in the attached hotel and had breakfast up here too which was excellent (and much more peaceful).",5,2 weeks ago

3,If you're after a sensational view of London this is it. Bar prices are not cheap but realistically if you're after amazing you pay for it. Gorgeous sunsets and view across the Thames. Restaurant also provides great food (albeit limited veg) and wine but again you pay for it... That said is London and a brilliant view and hard to fault quality... Recommend and will continue visiting,5,2 months ago
4,"Visited here in Sept with my son so that we could experience the views from the bar and we were not disappointed. Staff are courteous and friendly. We ordered a couple of drinks but they also do some light bites that did look really nice. We were pushed for time so ordered a dish of salted mixed nuts to go with our drinks and we then relaxed and took in the views. Would highly recommend this place for a nice drink, great staff and wonderful views across the city.",5,3 months ago
5,"Rooftop bar in Canary Wharf with a beautiful view of London and live music on Saturdays. Prices are not too bad apart from ¬£5 for a simple hot chocolate, so don‚Äôt order it, it is not worthy the money. If you want to have a table with a view, my advice is to book in advance. Waiters need better coordination, they wanted to charge me twice for the drinks.",4,a month ago
6,"After the lovely reviews and some research I visited Bokan Bar with my wife and her parents for NYE. I must say that the staff absolutely ruined the experience. There was a private section reserved for staff and presumably VIP guests on the side of the fire works. At midnight some people moved the boundary and walked in to the area and we thought that it is open for all guests temporarily while the firework lasts. We walked a few steps inside the area and shortly after a member of staff stepped in front of me and said that I can listen to him or he can call security (3 minutes in the new year). There are levels to how a waiter should communicate to a guest and this is coming from someone who spent years in a high end bar during university years. Threatening to call security should be the last resort and not the first. Sorry but I expected more from a place like this. I appreciate that the area was reserved, but for ¬£50 entry fee I would expect more professionalism in the most memorable moment of the evening. While leaving the venue, we had an interesting experience in the elevator where a member of staff discussed with an escort lady (in Russian) how someone is willing pay ¬£1000 for an evening. I was left extremely embarrassed in front of my wife's parents who had to listen to this conversation. I thought I booked an evening in a classy venue, not a brothel.",1,2 months ago

9,"Really disappointed! We had their tasting menu and it was not as good as the previous ones we‚Äôve had in the past. Maybe they have a new chef? Or have they become quite popular that they went for quantity over quality? Honestly, the only redeeming thing on the whole meal was the amuse-bouche. The rests were total disaster! The ambiance of the place has gone from being a fancy restaurant to a pub with a nice view. There was a band doing a Britney Spears song for crying out loud! The cocktails were also not that great! This is such a shame as we‚Äôve been recommending this place to our contacts. But after out latest experience, we would avoid this restaurant from now on. This is London. There‚Äôs plenty of great restaurants around.",1,2 months ago
10,"I had previously been to the coffee shop here but my friend suggested the roof top bar, which I had no knowledge about. Wow! There were great comfortable seating areas and the views were amazing! We sat outdoors, beneath the heaters, I could remove my coat as it felt like being seated indoors. Booking this place for a friend's engagement drinks soon.",5,2 months ago

18,"I love this place for after work drinks. An upbeat atmosphere with stunning views across London and a great drinks selection. It‚Äôs always buzzing but in a relaxing way, not a hyped up boozy way. Also a great spot for a Sunday morning coffee. Book for post-work drinks if you want a table with a view",4,5 months ago

21,"The place is beautiful, I've been to the cafe and rooftop and the view is great. Pricing is reasonable and drinks are pretty interesting. I have to admit though the table service was lacking. Quick in serving drinks, but incredibly slow in serving the ordered cheese board and dessert. Also asked for tap water twice and for the bill twice and the waitress didn't seem to remember. Other than that the quality was good.",5,6 months ago
22,It's a perfect spot for a sundowner and my friend loved the 'British Maori' cocktail. Staff were friendly and we really enjoyed the live band and funky house music later into the night.,5,a month ago
23,Spotted this place whilst staying at neighbouring hotel in the Docklands area and thought we'd give it a go on a Saturday night. We were lucky enough to get a table to enjoy the magnificent views over London. It's a perfect spot for a sundowner and my friend loved the 'British Maori' cocktail. Staff were friendly and we really enjoyed the live band and funky house music later into the night. We'll definitely return next time we're in London.,5,5 months ago

25,"We went to the rooftop bar with my family for having a drink and take our easy dinner after walking around all day. I could say cocktails were fine and the view is amazing to start with some positive points. But about the food I can't say anything good. I ate defenetely my worst burger in my life. It came in cold, arid bun with an overcooked meatloaf inside served with stale fries together. The duck salad was also pretty tasteless. Normally I'd send them back all immediately but we were too hungry so just ate and paid for it. Unfortunately non of the servers asked us if we were satisfied or not, actually it seemed they not even cared about. It is a shame because this fantastic location bar could be much better. üòâ",2,5 months ago
26,"The atmosphere and the view is just amazing. However, there is a lot of point that It did not make me feel comfortable. 1) Not very good organised, we gave our name four times to their staff. They did not look much coordinated to manage our reservation 2) Overpriced, we paid ¬£79 each of us for a chef's tasting experience and it was terrible bad. Each meal took around 15' minutes to arrive and the quality is not the best. There is no previous introduction or explanation for each dish. Definitely, we won't go again. you can get better service and quality food for the same price. 3) Drinks and Wine - overpriced, we paid ¬£30 for a red wine, the cheapest in the list and another ¬£30 for a cocktail and one double G&T.",2,5 months ago

35,"Have been coming to Bokan since Novotel opened. Absolutely love the place. A great bar, decent selection of snacks and a good enough Menu. As you'd expect in Canary Wharf, prices are high, so a regular meal here is unlikely. I usually attend with friends for some drinks and to enjoy the view. The restaurant itself is 2 floors and the highest floor is the open balcony, which in winter has powerful heating, so you can enjoy the open view of the skyline and be warm in doing so. Has all facilities you would need, including toilets and lifts. Although I can't remember seeing a lift to access the highest open balcony platform, so unsure of that. Here are some pictures of the iconic London skyline on a foggy day. Do follow my Instagram @vilbun_dsouza_captures for unique captures",5,2 weeks ago

We had the brunch menu with free flowing proseco ,so we had limited time to sit there,but no one rushed us and we never had to ask to fill our glasses with proseco. After we went to the bar to have few cocktails and to enjoy beautiful views from the 38th floor.all the staff was very attentive. Definitely will be coming back,we all had a nice afternoon.

The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable, definitely trust their opinion. Definitely worth a visit.",4,8 months ago
51,"The views are wonderful and the bar and terrace are great places to hang out. The restaurant is a different story. Despite our reservation, we were kept one hour waiting for a table. The person seemingly in charge introduced himself as Coco and was unapologetic, unhelpful and patronising. The food was good although not good enough for the price and the service way below standard, there didn‚Äôt seem to be enough personnel.

93,"Great views, however they really need to work on the speed of their service. When we visited there were maybe four or five people ahead of us at the bar, however there was only one bartender serving customers directly at the bar. Given the range of cocktails they have available this resulted in a half an hour wait to get served. More bar staff are urgently needed to make this place as slick as it could be. Other than that the bar area is very well presented and the floor to ceiling windows offer great views of the city. Be sure to go upstairs if the outdoor area is open",3,a year ago

My gf and me had a table booked at 6.30 pm in order to catch the whole sunset from the 37th floor restaurant. We ordered the 6 course menu. Usually tasting menus provide ""just enough"" food to be full. In that sense I can say I was left satisfied with the quantities. Regarding flavours the food was really good. I found the wild boar superb. The dessert was an excellent choice to finish the whole meal. Enjoyed the whole experience a lot. The staff was particularly nice and helpful. We were assisted not only with the wine choice, but also with a lovely picture with the awesome sunset behind us.

137,"Wonderful place to spend the evening. Nice views of London. Drinks were overflowing and good food. They have a top rooftop area that was a little chilly, but we stuck to the 38th floor which was warm and cozy. Very nice decor with a combination of wood, glass and metal. Sort of the warmth of a wood pub with modern glass and metal structure. I had the fish and chips with freshly made tartar sauce. The fish came straight from the fryer and was very light for this type of dish. My wife had Burrata Cheese with heirloom tomatoes and a Butcher's Tile with assorted cured meats. I nibbled a little on her dishes along with my fish and chips until I was full. I had a cocktail and a few beers and that was enough. The staff was very friendly and helpful considering we were Americans and neither of us has been back to London in years.

This seems to be a recurring theme with this place as this was not the first booking they stuffed up. I showed them my confirmation email so they gave me and my friends a table -shout out to the hostess who was very helpful. She was told by the manager that my booking was lost because I did not reply to the confirmation email (although nowhere in the email tells me to do this). Second, as there was no table service where we sat we had to go to the bar to buy drinks. I have no issue with this except for the fact that I got automatically charged a 12.5% service charge even though I went to the bar to get drinks. When asked, the bar man said that the charge was for him ""serving"" me drinks! I had to ask him to get rid of the service charge every time I get drinks from the bar.

The food and service was actually quite good - the waiter made a massive effort to be very accommodating and food tasted great. However, by Monday night 6/8 of us fell ill with fever, diarrhea and nausea. It could only have been this restaurant as we don't live together and went our separate ways straight afterwards. Even my brother that left a raving review became bed ridden along with his gf on Tuesday. We put it down the the raw fish starter as we all had a piece from that dish with only the couple that don't like raw fish not trying it. Sister contacted the restaurant and it seems like that aren't that bothered and only seem to fob us off which is a great shame as we spent almost ¬£500 and regularly dine out together for birthdays.

Vaste knowledge, amazing personality and a really nice guy, he made us feel so welcome and warm. Breakfast in the morning was good, a bit disappointed by a member of staff called Sebastian I believe, quiet rude and arrogant ( I don‚Äôt know what for) and suddenly we see Peter again and the spark immediately comes back into the room. Very kind and caring to all his guests, he goes around greets everyone and makes them feel comfortable, despite some of the IT issues that morning, he delt with them and reassured everyone professionally.

We were greeted at front of house and after confirming our booking she also confirmed that we had ordered a cake - totally ruining the surprise for me from my boyfriend which was super upsetting... It really doesn't take a genius to guess that it would most likely be a surprise. And she barely even apologised. The view is amazing, as is the atmosphere. The waiting staff are very friendly and accommodating when they can be (all 3 of them). However, the service was SOOO slow. Nothing flowed, you're sober by the time you get your next drink and forgotten what you've ordered when you finally get your next course, it really let's the restaurant and experience down as a whole. Our starter wasn't great - we had the octopus and the red mullet but our mains were delicious. I'd really recommend the cake as it's absolutely devine and the staff make it really special when they bring it over (maybe just make it very clear when booking that it's a surprise). I wouldn't recommend the restaurant, but only the bar and terrace area as they are worth it more.",2,a year ago

Not because it was busy but that's how long for someone to greet her. I joined her about 20-25 minutes later and her pea soup still wasn't out. It's soup! You have to get your own water, or at least that's what I think considering we asked for some and we never got any. For our mains which were the cheese board, vegetarian gnocchi and a salad and that took 50 minutes! Without any explanation from our server as to why it took so long. She never even came back to ask us how it was or offer us the dessert menu. We didn't even want to order any more at that point because we didn't want to be there for another hour. Then our server just up and disappeared. We had to ask some random lady (I think the hostess) for our check. I can't stand paying a service charge for such bad service! Unacceptable! I will say that the food is very good though and the cocktail menu looks phenomenal.",2,2 years ago

Get off at Canary Wharf, if your navigation skills are buffed, or alight at South Quay if your map reading is a bit iffy. Fabulous decor, good menu (if a little on the expensive end of the value spectrum) and all-in-all a really rather exceptional venue. If they could just improve the patchy service (and drop their prices by 10-20%) they‚Äôd bag five star reviews galore for sure.

At the time of booking it wasn‚Äôt made clear that a la carte menu won‚Äôt be available on weekends and you can only get the deal with bottomless Prosecco. If we knew this, we wouldn‚Äôt have booked it here. It‚Äôs not a great deal for someone who doesn‚Äôt like Prosecco or doesn‚Äôt drink alcohol, as they have no other option. You basically get charged for Prosecco regardless if you want it or not. Menu is also limited to couple of cheaper dishes from larger a la carte menu. I thought that this restaurant was aspiring to get a Michelin star, but with this kind of deals and lack of options for the customers I don‚Äôt think they are aiming for this anymore.

I went to the bar and asked one of the barman ""Can I order food here?"" as the start line of my conversation and out of nowhere he flipped and raised his voice, ""This is the 5th time you guys (he means my friends who have arrived 1hr earlier than me), asking the same question!! How many times do you have to ask me the same question?! Do you not talk to each other? I've already said yes we do serve food here but you have to come and take it upstairs because the room you're in is not officially open for public!!"" I just said ""well, I understand that, but I just wanted to make sure this is where I order food because I know it's a special arrangement we have so I wanted to double check."" But he continued to have a go at me for having to explain the same rule to our group of people for the 5th time. At this point I was so shocked by his attitude I started to ignore him and started to look at the menu but he was still ranting in front of me so I just left the bar without ordering anything because I felt really shocked by how I got treated like this for just visiting the bar. He was clearly taking his frustration out on his customer because he didn't know my group had a special arrangement and he didn't know what was happening. But regardless of the arrangement, if you are in the service industry, you are supposed to explain the same things day in and out to 100s of people so if you don't like doing that, you are in the wrong business my friend.",1,2 years ago

Price range is average for London and was expecting more but for the quality of service they provide please ask to remove the services charge. The welcome lady (different all the time at the bar entrance) is more on her mobile phone than greetings and welcoming people. Its Seems they don't care about details: 1) the ""no smoking sign"" is a paper laminated paper while on a place like this it should be on a wood or metal place screwed on the walls. You like to be upscale or not. They seems to choose not. 2) tables were not cleaned on immediate effect on the 3 different time I came. 3) the menu was not offered immediately when we arrived, sit (while we passed in front of 3 staff and 1 was chatting and talking but not providing the service) 4) the last time we wanted to order some food which on the menu was possible and which 2 tables around had. We were told there was no gas in the building and food will not be providing! Can you explain how they could prepare the food for the two other table that they just finish and if no gas in the kitchen I don't want to imagine how to boiled water for guest of the hotel and provide hot water in the bathroom.

You walk in early and surprise surprise, everything is already booked for the day!

467,"Extremely disappointing. Will not be returning or recommending to others. We booked this restaurant for a special occasion, a birthday meal for my boyfriend. Initially the doorman to the hotel at the entrance tried to turn my boyfriend away despite the fact he was wearing a shirt and trousers, he was also wearing white converse and therefore 'trainers'. As we were not informed there was a dress code upon booking a table, I have suspicions this could have been because another reason such as his race and nothing to do with what he was wearing. I did look on the website post our visit under their policy section to describe the dress code as ..... 'Smart casual. No athletic sportswear and shoes, no flip flops, no beach wear. Denim is acceptable. The team reserves the right to deny entrance should a guest‚Äôs attire and overall presentation not adhere to our dress code.' After making it up to the floor of the restaurant we were then told that as we were now 10 minutes late and therefore could no longer seat us at a table. Instead we were told we could have a seat at the bar if we wished. However, as the restaurant was not even half full this seemed unreasonable why staff flat out refused to seat us at a table for lunch. Needless to say we swiftly left and instead dined at The Big Easy, a few minutes away on the DLR. I suggest that the policy on dress code as well as the cut off for on a booking is explicitly made clear when booking a table so others do not also waste their time. We will not be trekking halfway across London to this establishment again. Dreadful.",1,2 years ago

On arrival we were seated and then left for a long time before getting water (other people were seated and attended too before someone came back to us). Drinks and the meal delivery were slow. We had started a tab for the evening and when we went to pay we had to ask 3 times and waited at the bar for someone to help us. In the end we were given our card back and then said their was issues with the till. After waiting another 5 minutes we asked again to pay (while watching other people pay and leave) so we could leave then waited a little longer, finally was able to pay. We didn't return during our stay.",2,2 years ago

480,"Great view - mediocre everything else. The staff were nice enough and (who I assume to be) the manager was very attentive. Our problem was with the goods/facilities.

We just became a bit more dumbfounded each time something cropped up that they didn't do.",3,2 years ago
481,"Appalling - What a SHAME I would like to start by saying I own a cafe and a restaurant so I know a fair amount about service and quality, this place lacked in both. My and my fianc√© went in for brunch, initially I asked for a window table and was told my ‚Äòrequest will be noted and on the day if we have it available we will give it to you‚Ä? they had three available but I wasn‚Äôt given a window table and sat next to a couple of rude Russians who were making fun out of people but didn‚Äôt have the guts to try it with me, anyways. I sat down ordered food and saw the empty tables being filled up next to the window who arrived after me, what was extremely rude is that one particular customer who she was on her own who just walked was given a window table only had a coffee and left and they didn‚Äôt offer me that table where I paid ¬£120 for brunch for 2, so they want to pick and choose who sits where, when confronted I was told the system made an error? What an excuse, absolutely terrible. The ladies name was Andrea and she didn‚Äôt have any reasonable excuses and was telling me ‚Äòmy apologies my apologies‚Ä?like I asked for her apologies I asked her what the policy for tables where but was telling me ridiculous excuses. Coffee.... requested a flat white and in a small cup they brought me over something that looked like a machine coffee extremely frothy and tasted like milk, I asked the waiter if this was a flat white and smiling she said yes???? I then called the manager and they brought another coffee in a big mug and called it flat white, if your an up-market restaurant at least offer decent coffee and if your offering a certain type of coffee please understand what your serving. Orange juice.... requested two orange juices and after the coffee blunder and not being offered the table I requested for I was getting slightly agitated, anyways, two problems I have to mention sadly one is which they don‚Äôt serve fresh orange juice and gave us carton orange juice... I mean really at a restaurant like this how can you serve carton juice for brunch? Just because you have an amazing view and amazing restaurant doesn‚Äôt mean you let the quality slide, Secondly the orange juice came to me with a dead bug inside, like does the waiter think that would be accepted as she is looking at it while leaving it on the table.... obviously requested it to be changed which left the waitress shocked. To this I say if you employ useless people they will provide useless service. Dessert, ordered the Dulcey and Blueberry desert and the taste was ok at best however the caramel ice cream when brought over to me was half melted, I asked the manager if this should be like this his response was ‚Äòif you make it wait this will happen‚Ä?in a weird accent, anyways the reason I didn‚Äôt tell the waiter to change it because it was obvious waiters don‚Äôt care so I had to tell someone with some authority which was the manager who thought I had waited for the ice cream to melt then complain about it? At this point i was asking for Jesus to give me strength to put up with these useless people. Qualify of the Food, nothing special trust me I have dined at some of the best places in London like most who are reading this and this place is nowhere near any of them... Views, definitely one of the best in London it is just mesmerising... just for this reasons it is a must visit but expect idiots to serve you with attitude.",1,a year ago

What a joke. When I went to the ground floor I went to take a picture sitting at the luggage trolley I didn't know I could not sit there. One of your receptionist member a short skinny male wearing glasses I didn't get his name He approached me so rude .telling me this is not a toy thank you! I understand that maybe I was not allowed to sit on the trolley but he could of been polite and told : excuse me ,sorry its not allowed to sit there. I apologise for the inconvenience ! I felt offended for the way he approached me . He looked miserable and unhappy . Not the kind of people you want to see when you arrive at a hotel reception .

Regarding the meal, we had crab: pretty plate, pretty good but limited amount. In the main course, we had risotto and pigeon. If the plate with the pigeon was good, the risotto was ¬£ 28 when it was much less controlled, tiny portion for the price but mostly bland and bathed in a juice equally bland. Given the prices, we expected better, dozens of French restaurants that we frequent from time to time serve equally good dishes. We would have liked to have more appreciation when we finished our meal and the waiter pretended not to see us favoring new customers and also no gesture of contempt when we asked for non-alcoholic beer. What we have not managed to do. Our waitress was nonetheless very friendly and attentive. Although the view is beautiful, I will not return to this restaurant.
