0,"Fantastic views over London, day or night. Staff were friendly & efficient. Food was good quality. Definitely worth a visit even if you are not staying at the hotel.",February 2020,4.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,748446054
1,We visited the bar in December 2019. Waiting for a long time to be seated. Very nice views of London. Staff tends to ignore you. Cocktails served in different types of glasses. We did not enjoy the food in the restaurant.,December 2019,2.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,735164769
2,Went for a drink at the bar but was ignored by staff. So I cannot comment on drinks or food. Restaurant might be nice but avoid the bar.,November 2019,1.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,731258294
3,"This was my first time visiting the Bokan having seen/heard many positive comments. My initial perception of the place was that it seemed very cool and modern which was followed by a vibrant atmosphere. I was lucky enough to find a window table which showcased just how amazing London is and how the Bokan Bar rooftop bar is truly a picturesque setting. The staff were friendly, in particular a guy named Breno who was highly attentive and provided a personable service. We were one of, if not the last persons to leave the bar and he ensured our glass was always full until the minute we left. Thanks Breno for your fantastic service and thank you Bokan for offering such a fantastic place to enjoy drinks in London. I will be returning. 100% recommended. My only feedback would be to extend opening hours.",December 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,731906126
4,It's obvious most come for the views which are spectacular. The staff are very friendly and pleasant. The security seemed good too as there were a few guys walking around and keeping an eye out. That's crucial especially with a place so high up.,January 2020,4.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,740082393
5,Perfect roof top bar in Canary Wharf for summer drinks and catching up. On occasion they have a live band which adds to the chilled out vibes!,August 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,730058592
6,"Me and my girlfriend went for couple of drinks to celebrate her b-day at Bokan bar 38. We been served by Martina, who recommend us very nice cocktail called 'old venues' which we really enjoyed and planning to come back to see amazing view from the bar and scenery of the river and city center. Truly recommended.",October 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,731680592
7,"Bokan is a 3 level rooftop bar, with a view over whole London, from the City. The atmosphere is relaxed and cheerful, there is live music and friendly service. The prices are very reasonable and it is just a perfect start for a Friday night!",February 2020,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,742334709
8,"I am coming very often at Bokan with my friends and always had a great experience, nice cocktails and friendly staff. However yesterday evening we did face a different attitude from the bartender Martina which was very rude to us and did not prepare the cocktail that we have asked and when we asked her for the cocktail that we wanted she started to argue saying that this is the cocktail and even start to laugh with her colleague and talking about us. I was shocked that at Bokan they still have people with this kind of attitude that don’t even bother about the guest requests. Very unprofessional. Really hope the management will take further actions.",February 2020,2.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,745371622
9,Amazing view and even better cocktails. Thanks to Stefano the cocktail maestro!,February 2020,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,748385648
10,"I was reccomended this venue by a waiter in another restaurant, I was skeptic upon reading the reviews but I decided why not to give it a shot. I don't understand the negative reviews! The place gets pretty crowded but that's normal when the view and the cocktails are so great! I didn't have any food but upon prying from other tables it looked great. I guess I will have to go back for that :)",November 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,728349677
11,"Went after work last few for couple of drinks - didn't realise until end of the evening a 12.5% service charge was added to every round or drinks that WE ordered at the bar. Then WE took back to our seats?? Can't understand why that was - service is for ""service"" not for someone doing their job/making drinks?? It does not say this anywhere until you have actually paid for your drinks and then it is on the receipt.",September 2019,3.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,715183063
12,Worth the view. We popped in here for a drink after work. It was a cloudy day but the view was amazing. G&T was £10 which is a bit pricey but probably par for the course in this area,September 2019,4.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,713299145
13,"Ate here with friends from out of town, had been many times for drinks but not to the restaurant. The food was delicious though the portions were quite small and dinner took an hour and a half to arrive so didn't hazard ordering desert.",September 2019,3.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,710680106
14,"Visited here in Sept with my son so that we could experience the views from the bar and we were not disappointed. Staff are courteous and friendly. We ordered a couple of drinks but they also do some light bites that did look really nice. We were pushed for time so ordered a dish of salted mixed nuts to go with our drinks and we then relaxed and took in the views. Would highly recommend this place for a nice drink, great staff and wonderful views across the city.",September 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,717949140
15,"We loved it! Absolutely fabulous view. Service really nice and polite, food delicious, worthy to visit.",July 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,721787500
16,"The views to the city with the tower bridge and Shard are amazing, there's also an open terrace and there's a great selection of drinks and snacks to pair the view ;-)",October 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,719884089
17,Stayed in Novotel. Used Boken bar on 38th floor and rooftop. £9.50 for glass of Prosseco and £3 for bottle of Coke plus 12.5% service charge even if you order at the bar ! Open to non residents. Worth going once (sunset) to catch the views over London. Restaurant and food not used. SX,October 2019,3.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,724684511
18,First waiting for a table at the entrance to see the staff letting others without reservation overtake us. Then at the table to waiter was so arrogant and rude that we simply left. Fantastic view though.,November 2019,2.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,727959956
19,"My wife and I celebrated our 1-year anniversary and booked Bokan, mostly for its lofty and impressive position on the 38th floor of the Novotel hotel in Canary Wharf, London. The view did not disappoint and we could see pretty much the whole of London from up there.",November 2019,1.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,723743170
20,"This wasn’t my first time at Bokan’s but this time was disappointing. Apart from the warm greeting by Constantine at our arrival and the spectacular views of London, the service, especially from one waitress was poor. It took a long time to order, she did not smile once and after ordering four drinks and four dishes, she presented the bill which already included 12.50% service charge demanding we pay it in full before taking one sip and well before receiving our food! If this is the bar’s policy (very peculiar to pay for food and service before even receiving it!), you should inform customers and explain it in a professional and friendly manner. The food wasn’t even that great. Only worth the views.",September 2019,2.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,708611677
21,"I visited the Bar and rooftop for date night last weekend and it was a lovely night. Coco was a fantastic waiter and he made sure my partner and I had a wonderful experience. The vibe was nice and the food was good. The rooftop was a perfect finish. The bar was quite busy but this is expected on a Saturday night. I would recommend and definitely visit again. The view is breath-taking, you really do see the beauty of London at night.!",June 2019,4.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,685661964
22,"Nice decor, friendly staff, great views, good atmosphere, cocktails were quite expensive and although worth the price for the view and surroundings just weren't to my taste as most of them were Gin based which I know is the 'in' drink but if you're not a fan of gin like me you might be disappointed with the cocktail menu.",July 2019,4.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,687782962
23,Stayed at the Novotel for the fourth time and did not want to go out for a late dinner. So I decided to go to the Bar and have something from the bar menu.,July 2019,3.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,690181494
24,"Although the menu is somewhat limited, with a choice of only 6 entree & mains, everything we ordered was thoroughly delicious. Plus you really can’t knock the amazing views! 4/5* Recommended #Bokan",July 2019,4.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,694224674
25,"I went on a walk on Sunday evening and was not dressed to visit a Rooftop bar. Suddenly, I passed the bar by hazard - I have seen it before on TripAdvisor but never visited it. So I thought might be good to quickly visit it.",August 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,695571146
26,"We are staying at the hotel, had lunch here.",August 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,699606818
27,"I ve been for the first time there, nice view but if you want some food at the bar, the best is to order the food first and the the drinks later, cuz it may take a while (in my case took more than 20 mins for some fries), the music is soo loud, it s like u re in a club, you can’t even have a discussion with the friends.",August 2019,2.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,699695135
28,I guess the main reason for visiting Bokan if you are not staying at the hotel is the spectacular view across the city. That is the reason we went for drinks here and it was very pleasant. It was busy and therefore service at the bar was slow but you do not come here if you are in a hurry so no problem. £10 for two bottles of Peroni seemed reasonable in the circumstances and we enjoyed our drinks and the amazing view.,August 2019,4.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,703074122
29,"Stunning views from both inside and out. Busy and difficult to get a seat, and definitely not cheap. Two cocktails were almost £25 once service charge had automatically been added - and you order your own drink from the bar so the definition of ‘service’ has been somewhat stretched. However, views really do make up for the cost.",August 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,700661937
30,This place has a real buzz about it and some of the best views in town. Perhaps a wider range of beers would be beneficial but overall well worth a visit!,May 2019,4.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,677601416
31,The place it's situated on the 38th floor of Novotel which gives an amazing view.,June 2019,4.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,679069080
32,The atmosphere here was lovely. The view was the best I had seen in London. We were able to see every landmark and the meandering river. Even the bathroom has great views! Cocktails were skilfully made.,June 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,678843352
33,"Both bars very nice, decor lovely, views amazing. Will definitately be visiting again. Very friendlubar staff.",May 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,681411884
34,Spotted this place whilst staying at neighbouring hotel in the Docklands area and thought we'd give it a go on a Saturday night.,June 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,682132611
35,"I arrived in an evening with friends, the view of London skyline at night is awesome, the service was great and the food hit the spot.",July 2018,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,684542863
36,"I absolutely love this place! I make sure I stop by every time when I’m in London. The views are breathtaking, cocktails always different and the staff very friendly. Veny is my favorite- always there with a smile on her face, polite and ready to help you. I can’t wait to be back soon!",June 2019,5.0,BOKAN 38 Bar & 39 Rooftop,682492047
