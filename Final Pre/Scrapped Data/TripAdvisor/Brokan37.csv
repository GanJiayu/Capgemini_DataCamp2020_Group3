0,"For about 2 years I've dinned at Bokan approximately 4 times a month and maybe even more. I even chose Bokan for Christmas lunch. I think I could be considered a good, if not a very loyal client. I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer. Goodbye Bokan. Your mediocre service will not take you far. By the way, The Ivy In The Park is also a wonderful restaurant that cares about their clients.",January 2020,3.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,743086109

2,"I dined here with friends on a Saturday night, restaurant was not crazy busy and we had a wonderful table by the window with an amazing view. This was the only positive point I can say about my dinner experience. It was not the first time for me here, I visited the bar and the restaurant few times and this was very disappointing: we went with the tasting menu and between the first 3 courses we waited a crazy amount of time (30/40 minutes) and we then asked if it was possible to speed up a little bit. After our request was taken very seriously and we did not even have the time to finish the following course that we have our plate cleared and the new course on the table.",January 2020,2.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,741502709

6,"We were on site so decided to visit. We shared a few starters and a main with a couple of cold beers. We arrived as the restaurant opened and were told there were only two lobsters left if that was what we fancied. Hopeless...The starters were good, we enjoyed those but when the mains finally arrived over an hour later all were dry and tasteless. For close to £ 300 pounds you would expect much, much better and I won’t bother again. Enjoy....",January 2020,2.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,741474592

26,"Bokan 37 is an expensive restaurant. So I expected the service to be top class too. However, it was very disjointed. On arrival, as a party of 4, we were not offered a drink but given the wine menu. So we selected a bottle of champagne. The waitress took our order for the champagne and the starters and main courses. She sent over the sommelier who recommended and left on the table a claret for the main course. We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening. Overall, the view is lovely, the food is tasty and beautifully presented but the kitchen is let down by a disorganised (but friendly) waiting staff.",December 2019,3.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,731119585
27,"Came for business lunch. All the staff were amazing, but very poor communication between the events manager and waitress. The events manager told us that we are not able to change the pre-order, but at the end of the day, the waiter changed without any problems. Also, it took a lot of time to organize because the events manager was super slow and not really friendly.",October 2019,4.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,736569319

29,This was my third time at Bokan and as expected it was magnificent! To the person who welcomes you yo the last spoon of desert everything is exceptional! Every time I go I discover new mix of flavours that I would never imagine could go so well together! It’s always a delight to the palate and the eyes! Again my compliment to Chef Guillaume and this time a very big thank you to the new Manager of the restaurant Florian who gave us a proper welcome! Can’t wait to go again definitely one of my favourite place in London!,December 2019,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,735357099

33,"My husband and I were staying at the Novotel for a couple of days and on our first night, decided to have dinner at Bokan. We were shown to a table and were sat for probably about 15 minutes before our order (drink and food) was taken. Around 40 minutes later, we still hadn’t received our drinks, never mind the food. This was despite a couple who came in after us getting both food and drinks long before us. The waiters kept walking past and looking at the table and could clearly see we didn’t have any drinks yet, but did nothing about it. It wasn’t until I got the attention of a female member of staff, who looked to be in charge possibly and mentioned it to her that something started to be done. It was however, an hour, before we even got our drinks and then eventually our food came out. We were charged a £7.25 service charge, which seemed excessive seeing as it took so long to get anything to eat or drink. When the food arrived, it was ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the wait. I wouldn’t recommend this place, we certainly weren’t made to feel very welcome and nothing was offered as an apology for the poor service.",September 2019,2.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,709002464
34,"Thank you so much to the lovely staff at Bokan for hosting us for our brunch yesterday. You might have seen this restaurant featured on Celebrity Masterchef recently and it lived up to the exceptionally high standard of providing quality food and service. We had the bottomless prosecco brunch and not once did we need to ask to be topped up. We were given a table with a five star view of the city of London, really beautiful. For starters I had salmon with steamed hen eggs and it was absolutely delicious. My wife had a tuna starter which she loved. The next course was sirloin cooked to tender perfection on the Josper grill. Fabulous. The plum dessert didn't disappoint either. The service was excellent and we would highly recommend this restaurant for brunch on a sunny day.",September 2019,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,711891680
35,We went to Bokan for dinner on a Monday evening as a bit of a last minute celebration. We ordered the lamb and the duck. The mains were both delicious and full of flavour. We had assistance choosing the best red wines to go with our meals which was fantastic. We were served by Katherine who was wonderful and friendly and described what all the foods were. We will definitely return. The decor is fab and the views are great. Can’t fault it.,September 2019,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,714338330

38,"We were kept waiting for an hour for a table although we had a reservation and stayed in the hotel. Coco, who appeared to be in charge of table organisation was unapologetic and patronising. There wasn’t enough staff to be attentive and alert. The food was good although the price had raised our expectations, which were not entirely met. I would give Bokan restaurant a miss, the bar and terrace are great.",November 2019,2.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,723759798
39,"The views at Bokan 37 were fantastic and we were lucky to have clear, sunny weather with lovely views over the London and the Thames.

40,"We had really bad service, change of courses took a really long time. Some of waiters speak English inseparably, so we struggled to understand them sometimes. One Polish waiter was like from distant village asking us “Are you okay now?”, “you didn’t like the food?” when I didn’t finish it. This kind of level would be acceptable in road cafe in Belarus but not on rooftop restaurant in London.",September 2019,1.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,708642279
41,"We treated ourselves to a big Saturday night dinner at Bokan and it didn’t disappoint. We had the tasting menu which was a foodies delight with lots if high notes including a wild boar and fig main which stole the show. A word about the wine though. Nelson the sommelier is an absolute star. I honestly can’t recall a better matched wine list for a tasting menu. And by Saturday night London standards it was fairly priced. What else? There’s great live music, a lively bar and terrace for drinks beforehand and of course the amazing view. Go on, treat yourself!",August 2019,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,701546248

43,Took my partner here for his birthday as he loves a meal with a gorgeous view and Bokan did not disappoint.

45,Absolutely terrible and unfriendly Service at the Bokan. Reserved weeks in advance for my birthday dinner and as it was in the middle of summer and 34 degrees our entire party was not let in because I was wearing sandals in the 34 degree summer heat! I have spent a lot of money at this place before and there was many other people wearing sandals in the 34 degree heat. They were very unfriendly about it and just told me I have to go; will never go there again!,August 2019,1.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,702922271

47,"Food was Delicious, pigeon best I’ve had and ribeye cooked perfectly. We were sat 15 minutes after time allotted but was no issue as we had a drink in bar. The only downside that stopped me from giving 5 star was the wait at bar (although I understood it was busy and mainly time consuming cocktails) and the poor service in the restaurant, while it seemed most of the servers were attentive and lovely our waitress openly complained about her number of tables (just 4) and treated the evening with a distain for her job that reflected in her lack of attentiveness and poor attitude to that table (her general demeanour was of one who didn’t care of those she served, 35 minutes to order food, no drinks offered throughout the evening and when we did eventually order drinks we had to ask another waitress to search for them, which she was prompt in doing) apart from feeling like this one waitress didn’t really want to be there our evening was great. We left the restaurant and enjoyed more drinks in the bar",August 2019,4.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,704749436

50,"Incredible experience! I came a few weeks ago with my husband for our anniversary. Very impressed by the quality of the dishes, the prawn starter and the duck for main was stunning, very tasty and unusual..! The lemon tart was also delicious.

I will come back soon, thank you again.",June 2019,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,686956996
51,"The meal we had was amazing. Although in a rush to see the show the staff were speedy, professional but also relaxed. they made the effort to come and speak to me while my wife used the ladies room. The food is to die for. Similar prices to similar venues I have been to like the shard or Fenchurch in walkie talkie building but the food is ten times better.

53,"I tried out the brunch on a sunny Sunday and was bowled over by the level of food and service. Seriously underrated restaurant and tucked out of the way in Canary Wharf, but totally worth a visit. Chef Guillaume is doing something really special up on the 37th floor at Bōkan - all three courses were a delight, especially the Josper grilled pork with padron pepper & potato.

55,"Based in the Canary Wharf Novotel this restaurant is the perfect place to have a relaxed brunch with delicious food and an awesome view.

57,"I chose king crab / pickles based starter (as did my wife), really enjoyed that. £14 each, not cheep. Mains, my wife had the organic lamb £32, me the Stone bass £29. Both cooked to perfection. However, I fed back to the waiting staff, the odd combination of white coco bean, as a fish-o-holic, always eager to try new combos, I simply didn;'t see the point, didn't work for me. No worries, fish was beautifully cooked so happy to leave the beans (apart from the 3 I tried).",July 2019,4.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,691855101
58,"A week or so ago I booked a table at the restaurant on 37 and was hoping to have a drink on the roof terrace on 39 on this wonderful warm evening. Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn’t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around £60 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant ‘unreal’ feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe. I personally love the established feel about more historic areas in London.",July 2019,4.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,688789999

The staff was not trained and inattentive. When we asked for the cocktail list, it took forever to arrive, and the waiter could not explain the cocktails and had to get another member of the bar staff. The same happened with the wine menu. Likewise, the waiters were unable to explain certain items on the dinner menu, i.e. what they were or how they were prepared. Everything took an absolutely extraordinary amount of time to arrive. We had endless wait times between courses and long periods with empty drinks. It was very hard to track down the waiters for anything, and we had to physically get up twice to grab one to place an order.

The atmosphere and view is great and the waiting staff are attentive, but the food was very much a 50/50 thing. The other half said his lamb was one of the best meals he'd ever had, my cod however had to be sent back as it was stone cold and raw in the middle (I suspect from the texture it was previously frozen). When the replacement (very quickly) came it was so very salty it was almost inedible, coupled with the over salted fries it made for a unpleasant meal which was marginally rescued by a fabulous desert .",October 2018,3.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,629332333

166,"We brought our guests for drinks on 2 occasions. The first time we were there, 2 people ordered a double gin tonic which we thought was watered down. As I could not drink alcoholic beverages during the second time we were there, I ordered orange juice which was also watered down. The view of the city is nice, but alcoholic drinks seem pricey; I guess you pay for the view. There is already a 12.5% service charge, so tips should not be expected but their system indicates otherwise and servers still ask if you want to give a tip or not.",August 2018,3.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,609801848

170,"I’ve been living in London for over three years, visited most of the “hip” bars in both West End and Shoreditch, and I can easily say that it is one of the best places in town. Bokan is amazing because of the incredible view of the city, delicious gourmet food and banging house music tunes. It is in the beautiful area of Canary Wharf so the crowd is pleasant and it is also not so busy - there is plenty of room across the three floors. Must go!!

179,"I have been meaning to write this review since our visit to Bokan. We actually visited on 19th May, which is our wedding anniversary as well as being the date of the Royal wedding. The place was absolutely buzzing with wonderful happy vibes due to the special occasion that many were there to watch on the large screens. We watched a bit and I have to say it was nothing short of spectacular to be able to watch the royal wedding with the London skyline as the back drop. They really had set things out nicely for those wanting to come along and partake in this celebration. We were made to feel extra special as it was our anniversary and every member of staff we encountered gave us their best wishes. We were seated and the views were, in my opinion, the best I have ever experienced in London. We were served by Guillaume and also the husband and wife team. They were effortlessly friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Honestly top notch staff! The food was delightful - we had the three course set menu, including the royal wedding cake. We even got a little bag of token chocolates to take with us, which was a lovely touch. The drinks flowed and we had an absolutely fantastic anniversary; and it was down to the incredible location and views, the food, the fabulous atmosphere and the amazing staff. Thank you! We will be back again for sure.",May 2018,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,606636091

We started with drinks on the roof terrace on the 38th floor which is amazing, especially as it was a clear, sunny evening. The atmosphere is fun and lively and of course the view is breathtaking. We had the Tasting Menu with paired wines and enjoyed every mouthful with special mention for the Salmon with mint & pea velouté. Service was good with friendly young staff and, although it was busy, it was still possible to hold a conversation across the table. We were there quite a long time and enjoyed every minute.

195,A wonderful gem near Canary Wharf in a Novotel. No really inside a Novotel. It is on a really high floor with fantastic panaromic views of London. Much more reasonable than the shard and great cocktails. We had a moijto and a rhubarb version. Pictures attached. Abt £12 each plus 12.5% service charge. The duty manager is crazy and funny. We asked could we sit on a reserved table by the window. He said let me check. Let’s call a friend like on who wants to be a millionaire. Then after a few funny comments gave us our table. We were served by a lovely Italian lady and service was great and almost endearing.

I spent a good chunk of time there each day during the week and the service was always amazing. Peter and his team were all super professional, but the Star of the show, and my personal favorite bartender (now friend!) was Liam. If you ever visit this bar, do yourself a favor and have Liam serve you. The guy is a beast at his craft and made some of the best drinks I've had in my life. Liam was a huge part of the trip's success so definitely request him if you stay there, he's hilarious! My friend and I loved him so much we even got a pic with him!

The menu is compact (I've been there 3 times in 3 months and the menu is the same). The chef favours undercooked fish, but will cook meat to your taste. The vegetarian options are tasty and include cheese, but I think a vegan may struggle to find something unless the restaurant is advised in advance.

210,"Would not touch with a 10 foot pole. Yes, the view is great (assuming you're there on a good day). But the service was painfully slow (took them 45 mins to get our food out after taking orders) and you could tell the staff would much rather be elsewhere. When the food arrived, it was... below average. Not even average. At least, that was the case for me (I had a fried salmon... it seemed like their twist on fish and chips but the flavours were not a good combo, shall we just say). Now if you asked my fiance, the response is more like ""the food was horrible"" because he got a terrible case of food poisoning that very evening, after the lunch we had there. We didn't have anything else unusual that day so that lunch at Bokan was the likeliest culprit. His food poisoning was so bad he had a fever and missed two whole days of work afterwards.

217,"I always visit Bokan because I am simply impressed with the views - they are stunning. We always walk-in and very kind reception ladies try to accommodate and find a table for you. 6 of us went to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time - bill was £500 but we had great food, amazing wine. However, let me tell one very important thing - bar team and waitress are always rude (not restaurant's). I never complained to any of the managers but I cannot hide it anymore. The last time I went there - we were 3 ladies and ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress brought 2 glasses only but and I kindly asked to get 1 more glass (obviously). We waited for 15 minutes but there was no one and still didnt get the glass. I went to the bar, no one paid any attention. Then I found the same waitress and again KINDLY asked to get an empty glass because we are 3. She was so arrogant and started to show her embarrassment by saying: ""I told you that I'm bringing it."" I cannot believe.. I said I cant wait any longer because it has been more than 15 minutes! Then she was putting an order to the till and just ignored me completely. I turned to the bar and waited for anyone to look at me and requested a glass by raising my voice: PLEASE Is anyone can pass me an empty glass? It was such an awkward situation.... After 25 minutes we finally had a possibility to enjoy our wine. Next time I tried to get a recommendation about Riesling wine which they used to have on the old drinks menu. The bartender didn't show any interest in even trying to find my taste. And there is always issues with the bar team and this particular floor - I don't understand why? General manager and restaurant manager need to look into this as I can see from the other reviews - it's happening very often. I think they are all demotivated or tired. To be honest with you, I will try to look for another good place in Canary Wharf on the top floor (didnt try any of other yet) because of this bar and team's attitude as I can't bother anymore - it always changes my mood.",May 2018,3.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,585263636

You can right over London with its lights and skyline so well worth it. The bar itself is decent and well in line with others in town although the service can be slow and the cocktails are at best almost half the size of anywhere I’d been during the day yet the priciest I’ve seen in quite a while. But this is London and your basically paying for one of the best views....... a comment I will make to the detriment is that we were twice approached by ladies of a ‘working disposition’ this didn’t make the ladies in our group comfortable.",June 2018,4.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,586584759

Except the wrong drinks were transposed, the bar staff didn't bother to print off order, waiting staff didn't bother to check that it had been started on even after a number of queries about delays and the non-alcoholic cocktails were served with alcohol.

In terms of location the bar, restaurant and rooftop terraces all offer amazing views across the city overlooking many of the capital's landmarks. The environment is modern and comfortable and our host Veni ensured we found an ideal location from a choice of available spaces. The selection of beers and wines available is extensive and the team demonstrated their deep knowledge to make recommendations which exceeded our expectations. I haven't had the opportunity to dine at Bokan yet but look forward to this with the options on offer. If you want a highlight to your visit to London Docklands Bokan comes highly recommended.",March 2018,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,569916662

At first glance the prices look a bit expensive ( I’m a student so don’t have a big budget) but when the food arrives you know why it’s priced. I’ve never eaten food with so much flavour before, it was totally worth the money. And the service was amazing, every member of staff made us feel so welcome.

249,"Overall a poor experience, we were three mates looking for quick dinner before going out. Arrived at the restaurant on the 38th floor, there was no hostess to be seen for at least 5 minutes and no one had greeted us, so we decided to make our way to the restaurant which is a floor below, once we got there again there was no one to greet us. After wondering around the restaurant a waiter appeared we asked if we could have a table for three. His response was you need to go back upstairs to the hostess desk and they will allocate you a table. Once we got upstairs there was a lady which didn't seem too happy to see. Anyway she brought us to the table.",April 2018,2.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,571783276

Once again again we were amazed by the unique flavours and textures of her dishes. From the starter to the dessert it’s a journey of surprise and different tastes that will not disappoint you.

255,"I was staying in the hotel so reception kindly booked me a table. I stated I had food intolerances upon booking and this was noted. I was greeted and shown to a table and although initially service was attentive I was not given guidance on allergens in the menu and I had to try ordering a few options until I got one I could have. I would have expected the waiter to be more clued up on allergens and to be more helpful. It’s not like it’s a cheap restaurant. When my steak came the meat was cooked medium rare as requested but it wasn’t a good piece of meat and was quite chewy. I’m from a farming family so I know good steak and that wasn’t the quality I’d expect at a restaurant of this calibre. Something had been excluded from the dish due to my gluten intolerance but that had not been pointed out when I ordered. So, great that it was omitted however this should have been mentioned at the time of ordering. The “Amuse Bouche” was just brought to me and I had to request the waiter check the ingredients before I had it - again disappointing. I actually felt like I was a pain to the servers because of my allergies and other tables seemed to get more attentive service as I was sat there with an empty glass for ages and being ignored. All in all, great views, nice wine list but below par steak and below par service - specifically around allergens.",March 2018,3.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,565330501

Bottle of wine, 4 beers, 2 tasting menus and 2 a la carte menus with starters, main and desserts £332 so not the cheapest place to eat out on a Saturday night. Not a child friendly place really as it’s quite grown up and adult. 12.5% added automatically. Our last course was forgotten about on the tasting menu so we had to ask. No big bother really.

276,"The view is lovely, as is the food. You enter the building prime time on a Saturday afternoon and expect to see someone on the podium of the entrance but there isn't. So you have to work out for yourself how to use the lift and which floor you need to go to. We ended up in the bar, but the woman at reception couldn't understand a word we was saying. Despite us being locals. She thought we was wanting to book a table, despite us repeatedly saying ""we are here for our 2pm booking"". Then we was seated in the bar area at a table that was practically on the floor. I asked to be moved to a table where we wouldnt have to eat with our food on our laps. He then gave us a bar menu. We asked if we could have the brunch menu which we booked for. He said this was downstairs but the brunch was now over. I advised I had checked online and that I was sure the last SEATING for brunch was 2pm and it started at 12. However it get very confusing as he couldn't really understand what we was saying either. We were just about to leave when we checked to say are you sure we cannot have a table and he said that we could but we had to order as the kitchen takes the last orders for brunch at 2:30pm.

Despite having received an email confirming our booking she kept us standing in the corridor for 10 mins and kept insisting that we did not have a booking!! I even showed her the email. She was disingenuous and disinterested. In the end I asked to see her booking screen and was able to locate the booking immediately.

Would imagine this bar gets very busy on a Friday night when all the business people in Canary Wharf leave work places.

We went there on Sunday about 5pm and listened to a Jazz combo while having a bottle of wine and some nibbles. The prices of drinks and food are typical hotel prices, but given the views and music, it was well worth the cost. Best to reserve as this will become quite popular once word gets around.

345,"Yes the views are amazing, yes the cocktails are good but these mean nothing if the service does not live up to the expectations. Their booking policy for the terrace appears to be simply untruthful and misleading. It's understandable that during good weather it will be busy. What is unacceptable is when you ask them to book they say that the system is blocked. Even if you say that you will call later they say that you cannot book and that you will have to walk in early. You walk in early and surprise surprise, everything is already booked for the day! So basically they will not tell you that they are fully booked and you're lured in by the hope that there will be availability.

After confirming our reservation she took us to our table. The place have amazing views and the decor is fantastic. The cocktail menu is creative but maybe a bit to long. We ask for 2 cocktails that took around 20 minutes to arrive. for the second round we choose a glass of wine and a beer as we didn't wanted to wait such a long time but it took more than 30 minutes to arrive.

I would definitely stay there again and recommend it for sure. The only ""negative"" comment I had read about the hotel was the very slow service at the bar or the restaurant. OMG, beyond SLOW.......staff walked by me and totally ignored me and my friend. I even stood at the bar wanting a glass of wine, was standing right in front of the bartender who was YES I KNOW very busy, but he could have at least acknowledge my presence......It took for ever to get a glass of wine, and than had to ask for my check......Having said that the staff for the brunch if wonderful and if this obvious they are there to serve you and make sure your visit is as enjoyable as possible. Another comment, is that there doesn't seem to be enough tables on the 3 floors to accommodate the number of guests staying at the hotel. Also, there was NO information in the room for phone numbers such as room service, front desk, wakeup call, etc....and no visitor guide or magazine. I do have to say that these are minor issues and the hotel still deserves a 4.9 stars our of five.........",July 2017,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,507234778

375,"Went for a friends birthday, and the surroundings, ambiance, and stunning views of London seemed like the ideal scene to have some drinks and celebrate. There were only 3 of us, and the staff seem friendly, the drinks kept coming, and we was having a great time. My friend accidentally knocked a drink over, and within 2 minutes the manager came over and said that security was watching us and to calm down. (Knocking the drink over may have been coincidence). We were having a great time before this and would have easily stayed in there until closing, and spent a lot more money, but this made us want to leave straight away. The gentlemen could have come over to make sure we was good if he had a concern, or seen if we needed anything, but it felt like because security said something to him, he came over as the man, and told us to calm down. It put us off and I don't think we will be going back. There are enough rooftop bars in London, which are cheaper as well, and you won't get accused of anything either.

As there were so many of us, we sent our meal choices in advance. The waiter confirmed with us and noted who was having what. When the food came, everyone was served at the same time. The starters were magnificent, such intense and amazing flavours. When the main course came none of us were disappointed. The steak, fish and chicken dishes were cooked to perfection and accompanied with eye catching purées and foams that were packed with complimentary flavours. The wine was great, also full of flavour but not overbearing - just right! It seemed a shame to stop at the main course...the puddings and cheeses matched the quality and flavours we had already experienced and the sommelier picked us a wonderful wine to finish.

The menu is not incredibly long but it does have to offer a great number of dishes, I would recommend the squid as an appetiser and the lamb or to be on the safe side: go for the rib eye steak, you cannot go wrong with it. The interior is fantastic with its large windows that provide you with a great view of London from above. I will definitely be coming back, especially for the bar, which offers a huge range of interesting non-classical cocktails.

At the door the front of house had the snottiness attitude and was not the least bit welcoming. The bar staff had unwarranted attitude and were argumentative at every opportunity irrespective of the amount of money we were spending. They had the utter nerve to keep changing the prices of our drinks because the menus were in the ""process of being updated""! Here's a tip, update the menus and THEN put them on the tables! Don't tell your staff to come up with rough numbers and then get aggressive when we state our basic consumer rights.... Unfortunately we have to return here in a few weeks for a corporate event.

We were certainly not disappointed, they are really really superb. As the bar has floor to ceiling windows, you get a spectacular view of central London. Luke who served us in the evening was also very nice and very friendly, he even made a bespoke cocktail for my friend. Jeevan who is the manager there came and checked on us often. To be fair we were there from 4.30pm - 1am, but even still it was very nice to be checked upon and so looked after by Jeevan. He also gave us a show around of the restaurant and the roof top bar. We will definitely return. The only small feedback would have is to change the olives in the bar, they really did not taste good, they were almost bitter. We had a great evening at Bokan and would definitely recommend to anyone to go there for a drink..friendly staff and amazing views guaranteed!!

394,"The bar lounge on level 39 has really lovely panoramic views. Unfortunetly, the service is dreadful. I have never come across such rude staff anywhere in London. My colleague's birthday drinks were totally ruined. The hostess on level 38 was abrupt with no customer skills. I was made feel unwelcome. Bar staff on level 39 were even worse. On several occasions when trying to buy a drink I was totally ignored. After waiting for some time I was told I had to queue somewhere else. No further details were given or explained to me. Buying a drink each time was such a challenge. Settling payments was another issue - each time different prices were applied for the same drink. A tall waiter kept coming to our area throughout the night reminding us how we should have booked a table, despite half of the reserved ones being empty. I don't understand why would you want to turn spending clients away when the place is half empty. The overall experience was very disappointing. As an employee based in Canary Wharf, I was very excited about the opening of this venue. I thought it would be great for team outings, Friday drinks, leaving parties, etc. There is no way I'm coming backing to Bokan and will not recommend to it to anyone in Canary Wharf.

She said if we could find a table then we could sit at it but she didn't like the idea of 20 people and not sure why as we all have jobs and money! It took a man in our party to get a table for us and then she gave me dirty looks all night. The last straw was the prices advertised on the menu were not what we were charged. The prosecco was £10 more! Also they add 20% to your bill when you buy from the bar! Surely this is not legal!

401,"We have visited the bar on the 38th and 39th floor of the new Novotel hotel. This place has a really relaxed chilled atmosphere during the day and lively in the evening. Well designed except maybe the chairs which lack of comfort, absolutely stunning views of central London and East London. More importantly the cocktail menu is original and if you don't fancy any of it, the experienced bartenders can be creative around your taste buds. The oudoor space is fantastic spot, although you can imagine in high demand. So book a table in advance. Has become our regular since it's opening. Quite surprising to find such venue in a Novotel.",June 2017,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,494036427
402,"Worth coming here for the views. Needless to say the cocktails are great and the food was excellent. I dont normally go for burgers, but I had the burger here and really enjoyed it. It is expensive but what you really come for are the views. 38 storeys up with a great view of the London skyline - by day or night. We saw Tower bridge opening in the distance! There is loud music and lots of banker types, but we got a table both times we visited the bar (we only ate bar food here) and had a lovely evening. Definitely worth a visit.",June 2017,4.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,492474414

The Chef came out to say hello and we heard her story of coming to work at Bōkan. All very interesting and made us feel very welcome.

We was then approached by Julia who should not be working front of house and rudely said you cannot sit there even though there was no one else to take the table at the time truly disgusted with her attitude and really had put he of going to what is in theory my local bar I suggest Mondrian at London Bridge there rumpus room bar is a lot more better run with friendly staff.,June 2017,1.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,493782764

They did this twice by asking him if I wanted dessert or should they bring the cake out!!! Talk about incompetence. Yet they wanted a form filling in prior to attending which was done in great detail. Clearly they don't communicate with each other.

424,"So, on the recommendation of a friend, and seeing the published photos this looked a great place to have dinner and also see the London skyline. It certainly didn't disappoint. Our table was booked for 7.15pm and we were promptly walked to out table. A cloudy day, and what could have dampened the view , soon changed to sun streaming through the cloud to highlight The Shaard and Millenium Wheel, sites we were able to see from our seats at the window table. Although the table had a 2 hour rebooking slot, something made clear in the booking, we were not made to feel as though we had to rush off or that someone was waiting for the table. As for the food. Well this has to be some of the best I have tasted in a while. From the 'amuse-Boucher ' to the main course of fillet steak, all tasted amazing. Will definitely be going back. Will have to just make up a special occasion to justify the visit. The icing on the proverbial cake has to be the roof terrace. The views from here, once evening had taken hold, were amazing. Being a little chilly that evening meant we couldn't spend as much time out there as we would have hoped but in the summer, provided it's not too British, this will be the only place you will want to be.",May 2017,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,486580838

There were lots of security guards, some friendly, others less so. We were given a cocktail menu within 5 minutes of sitting down. No sign of waiting staff 15 minutes later so went to the bar to order. They take your card number to open a tab. Only stayed for one drink as a bit chilly and the seating wasn't great.

Very impressive views out over Canary Wharf, the interior has been well designed and the view from the men's loos is something else (we all made a point of going for a look). However we waited an hour for our starters to arrive and thought they were nice it wasn't worth an hour's wait. The chef clearly was struggling and sent an amouse bouche to keep us occupied but we had to ask for bread which should have come as standard. The mains were nice but I was certainly not going to leave feeling stuffed. Slight style over substance and for the price I would expect more of a complete plate of food. We were there not long after opening so it may have been a glitch, it was only half full so they would not have coped with a full service.",April 2017,3.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,480252443

I'm sorry to say, but given that I work in this industry too, I would expect the whole staff to be much more professional and welcoming. One of the bartenders kept arguing with the waitresses (one of them even started to cry, everything in front of the guests), and he tried to apologise by offering us the second round of drinks.

As we had ordered food, the barman refused to serve my partner at the bar, absolutely disgusting, it's the customers choice if they wish to order at the table or go to the bar.

We eventually ordered a bottle of prosecco, which took 45 mins to arrive and 2 trips to ask why it was taking so long. We ordered a cheese platter to start, and waited almost an hour and half for this to arrive.

The service was that slow that my husband ended up going to the bar himself which again was a completely disorganised. Whilst he was getting the drinks, I was asked to move as the table I was told to sit at was also booked. At this point, I was pretty mad and my husband and I left shortly after our first drink.

Portions were very small (agree gourmet food has smaller portions but this was smaller than dishes served at the Dorchester, Oblix etc) and whilst they were presented well, the food was below average vs. similar restaurants and somewhat bland.

Definitely worth the money (and the view helps) To top it off,the nice waitress (unfortunately did not get her name) heard it was my birthday and went over and beyond and gave me a small cake from Paul and the team. Completely unexpected and just makes us want to come back again!! Next stop the roof top!",March 2017,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,469325229

489,Four of us visited Bokan for dinner on a Friday night. We had booked the restaurant on the 37th floor for 6pm followed by a booking in the rooftop lounge on the 39th floor at 8.30pm. We were meeting up with some friends who we hadn't seen in a while.,March 2017,3.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,470009433
490,"Visited the bars on the 39, 38 floors and have to say I Was really impressed with the cocktails and the quality of service! Thank you Juan! My drink was amazingly well made and I very much enjoyed the presentation and added twist of edible flowers made it special.. this really impressed my date and the staff were very knowledgeable about their drinks!",February 2017,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,465838482

492,"We had an almost perfect family lunch on a Sunday. Our table was in a corner which gave us a incredible 180 view over London. The food by Chef Aurelie was amazing, super fresh and very creative. Don't miss the ""Mushrooms, Hen's Egg & Toast"" and the succulent ""Hereford 28 Day-Aged Ribeye Steak"". The service was not only prompt and faultless but very friendly too. Last but not least the decor is stunning, nothing like I've seen before. Prices are very affordable for the level of quality. Overall would highly recommend!",February 2017,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,466553846

495,"What a stunning new rooftop bar in Canary Wharf ! Delicious cocktails, stunning views and most of all.... impeccable service ! I only went along with a friend of mine for a few cocktails as restaurant tables were fully booked as a result of a 50% discount offer until 15/03 via squaremeal.com BUT hope to soon also sample the food ! The service of the staff was excellent. Our waiter went the extra mile. Shame I missed out on the special 50% introductory offer in the restaurant. Hopefully this review might lead into an extension to his offer for locals living in the vicinity.",March 2017,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,467396334

497,Tried the place for drinks and we booked the day before. The receptionist Sandra remembered me when I booked and gave us a very warm welcome.,March 2017,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,468368329
498,"We had booked for the soft launch period but we were unable to reserve in the restaurant so we were offered the bar. There was a warm welcome on arrival and we were taken to a high table in the bar. I asked the person who showed us to the table if the food came from the same kitchen in the bar and the restaurant but she said it was a better menu in the restaurant, which I expected. Then she said that they had had a cancellation in the restaurant so could move us to there, which we were very happy about. Our table was right next to the window and the view was fabulous. The decor inside the restaurant and bar is very industrial, with big windows really making the best of the view. The only issue we had was the music. It was kind of annoying and it would have been nice to have something a bit more mellow to enhance the sophisticated atmosphere. We selected a very nice bottle of portuguese red and looked at the menu. Some excellent bread was brought to the table. The menu wasn't huge but we both found things we wanted to try. For starter we shared the Bokan board which had a selection of charcuterie, cheese, pate and a scotch egg. The pate lacked a bit of flavour but the scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny centre. For main we had the pork belly and venison pie, both were very tasty. The desserts were also very good and beautifully presented, plus good coffee to finish. The service throughout was charming, friendly and helpful. Overall we had a lovely evening. The full price of the meal would be a little high but this is definitely a place to come for a special occasion.",March 2017,4.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,467983973
499,"This place has only been open a few weeks so one would expect a few glitches. Yes the service was a bit slow and took a while to get our orders but the view more than compensated for the delays. The staff were very accommodating and knowledgeable about the food. The menu offers an eclectic mix of dishes. The starters were adequate and the choices did not particularly excite but the main course of venison pie was outstanding. The dessert was even better. The ginger pudding was full of flavour and melted in the mouth. My fellow Diner commentated that it was the best dessert they had had in 20 years. I will be back in a month to see if the issues have been ironed out and then will give a more critical review. However I can see this as becoming one of the best restaurants in Canary Wharf, if not London.",March 2017,4.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,467670165
500,"We sat in the bar area for a light business lunch, after waiting 20 minutes the waitress took our drinks order, she was clearly new and nervous, this wasn't the problem but the 30 minutes then waiting again to order food was frustrating, then 20 minutes for the food to come, I received to orders of my meat board, I had to ask the restaurant receptionist for the bread, my colleague had ordered soup of the basis that cream was not in it, due to a dairy intolerance, unfortunately this was not the case. A 25 minute wait for the coffees was the final straw, as a local business we were hoping for a fabulous restaurant nearby for lunches, not many companies allow for a 2 hour lunch break, the views are the only thing that impressed... really disappointed",February 2017,2.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,463988774

503,"Fabulous food and an amazing view. The bar and restaurant occupy floors 37-39 and offer simply stunning views across all directions over London. The bar has an extensive list of cocktails and very helpful staff. Presentation is first class. The restaurant may look casual but the food is superb. We enjoyed an excellent meal suggested by Aurelie the head chef, recently at L'Atelier Robuchon- a wonderful range of flavours and textures - lentils with foie gras and duck with radish and wasabi dressing; red mullet perfectly cooked; a refreshing palate cleanser of mint and cucumber; and succulent, tender slow cooked lamb:; and finally a light creamy dessert with lime and sesame. Wonderful. Oh and the view. A great location for a night out.",March 2017,5.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,464700135

505,"We had dinner and drinks at Bokan and were blown away by the experience - from the staff's friendliness to the excellent food and drinks (recommend the lamb chops and charcuterie plate!). The venue itself is stunning in decor and the view makes for a truly special experience - it works well for a date night as well as a night out with colleagues.

506,"We had dinner here not long after they opened. I'm guessing staff were still being trained - we had a few problems getting what we'd asked for, but the staff were charming.

509,"Bokan the restaurant is not quite at the top of Novotel Canary Wharf (or to be precise in a rather nondescript road through a closed mozzarella bar and over a canal and a short walk south of Canary Wharf). It's on the 37th floor, accessed by an impressively swift lift to the 38th floor bar and reception area, itself just below the 39th floor roof terrace. Unsurprisingly it's biggest attraction is the view it commands over vast swathes of London and from my seat northwards as far as Hertfordshire. A pity then our view was impeded by the fact we were seated at what seemed to be the only table adjacent not to a window but a metal frame. In addition to the a la carte was a lunch menu featuring two courses for £22 and three for £26. This represented quite a bargain compared with the a la carte many of whose mains (without sides) cost as much if not more than three courses on the set menu. The 50% discount on food as part of the soft launch, however, gave us an excuse to go a la carte. There is no children's menu (indeed my daughter appeared to be the only child dining) but a main of spaghetti with tomatoes and pesto was served with our staters and, as requested, without olives. It was such a substantial dish it kept her occupied beyond the finish of our mains. My wife started with burrata which was suitably creamy although the accompanying crackers were not particularly crispy. My steak tartare was beautifully served on a plate with little spots of dressing but could have had more egg yolk whisked in than I noticed. My main, a poached fillet of cod on a bed of spinach with shrimps covered in a brown foam was a sensational dish, but at £26 at full price perhaps needed to be. My wife's chunks of salmon on green beans looked a little more prosaic by comparison. A ginger pudding we shared for desert hit another high note, but the bitter stewed espressos were fairly horrible. My wife and I are admittedly fussy about coffee but never cease to be amazed by the sheer unpleasantness of espressos served in so many venues in London including those that specialise in coffee such as Caravan who really ought to know better. We enjoyed our glasses of house white until they were shown on the bill as Chablis at a fairly astonishing £9 per glass as opposed to the £5.40 for the eminently quaffable vin du maison. So all in all an accomplished meal not without the odd blip and, in common with the location of the restaurant within the hotel itself, not quite hitting the heights.",March 2017,4.0,Bokan 37 Restaurant,464803410
