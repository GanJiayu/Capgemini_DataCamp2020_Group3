3,Madhu's,739981237,January 2020,"Excellent service, excellent food and great ambience. Had 43 guests and everyone, from elderly to kids, enjoyed the food. Our waiter, Franco and Rahul were so caring and friendly. I already had my friends saying that they would be visiting Madhu's again. The arrangements made were simply great - the manager, Khush, was very understanding and patient with me as I had a hundred questions - giving him a call everytime for anything I was unsure about prior to the function! Also, had a guest who had gluten and dairy allergy and the team were understanding and made sure that guest was aware of the ingredients in the dishes. All the guests were very well looked after and catered for. All the arrangements made were discussed with me and then finalised.",5.0

5,La Dolce Vita,737560471,January 2020,"Yet another fabulous lunch at La Dolce Vita. I started the New Year determined to break out of my habits and try doing something different. So although we decided to go to one of our favourite places for lunch I did choose something different on the menu, which is also a new addition. The tagliatalle vongole with pistachio chilli and garlic. I think this is a southern Italian/Sicilian speciality. It may seem an odd combination but it is divinely moreish. I used to have the boar ragu which is also delicious but a craving for seafood usually means you need something it offers. The clams were plump and meaty and melt in the mouth and the combination of flavours perfect. My family loved their pasta with swordfish and seafood special, the corn fed chicken with mushrooms, huge thin real italian pizza and we started with perfect calamari and prawns - not greasy or chewy but crisp and perfectly cooked. Bread and olives are also complimentary unlike some places which sadly overcharge for this. House wine is fine. As ever Maurizio is the perfect host and you cannot get a warmer welcome. The ambience is lively and a real mix of clientele. Looking forward to a return visit when my resolution will probably go out the window!",5.0

32,Q Verde,711407121,September 2019,"My wife & I booked for early dinner (18.30) at QVerde after a day visiting Kew Gardens. Found the restaurant online as my wife loves Italian food, but as always when booking ""blind"" not sure what to expect. Needn't have worried - it was a really great meal. One of the best Italian meals we've had in a long time! Location is good for Kew Gardens (5min slow walk from Kew Gardens station) and the welcome/service is very friendly. The food was excellent and the House Red was a good quality ""House"" wine. Be aware however, it's not ""cheap"" and it is clearly specified on the menu that they add 12.5% service to the bill (""discretionary""). Still think it was worth every penny, and would highly recommend.",5.0

36,Q Verde,713636576,September 2019,"We must have been here 20 times since we live in Kew. It is a busy but friendly local restaurant with good food and decent wine and a free grappa/limoncello with the bill. One of best things is the mixed starter for all. Not cheap but a talking point and an ice-breaker. I love the liver with sage, my girls love the pasta. We all enjoy the evening (or lunch). I don't really have any negatives other than it can be draughty at the table by the door (avoid in winter). Best table is the round table in far corner as you come in if you a large group.",5.0

However, because you have no choice but to have a three course set menu at a fixed price you pay for more than some people can eat. The dinner menu at £45 without wine sounds reasonable value but by the time wine and coffee are included the evening will costs around £75 a head so this is definitely a special occasion venue for most people. All that said, I had the most sublime starter of scallops with a chorizo crust followed by an incredibly rich Cornish lamb dish which was simply too much. Dessert was lovely but under normal circumstances I wouldn’t order it.

We only had two courses, starter and main, and it was first class. We could not pick any difference between the food for lunch and dinner except the price. At just over £20 for two courses it is a bargain. We both had a confit duck dish to start and it was fantastic, perfectly married with a blackberry sauce. It was pretty large for a starter. I had pork belly for my main, something I don't normally order but The French Table does pork so well and this dish was no different. It as fantastic. My wife's chicken ballotine special was also very good. In addition to all this, we were regularly congratulated on our anniversary and were treated to a surprise dessert.

300,Mezzet Lebanese Restaurant,664056584,April 2019,"We are very lucky to have Mezzet restaurant as our local. And it is one of the best Lebanese restaurants I have been to. Food is fantastic. Menu has a good selection of hot and warm starters, main dishes and desserts. Portions are quite generous; we often leave with leftovers that are very tasty next day for lunch. And the traditional baklava at the end of the meal is really divine. Not surprising Mezzet is very popular, so if you plan to visit it for dinner, recommend to book a table beforehand not to be disappointed, as most likely it will be fully booked. Mezzet have a nice wine selection. We really like Lebanese wines. If you want to give these a try - ask for Ixsir Reserve. It is pricy, but really worth it. Smooth and velvety red. Jonas will be there to answer any questions you have and give recommendation on what wine will work with your meal. He makes you feel very welcome and looks after you with a smile. So in summary I would describe Mezzet as great food, great service and great atmosphere. Highly recommend it.",5.0

The waitress came to take our wine order almost as quickly as we sat down, we asked for more time and we were nicely approached again too soon. When we were ready to order we flagged down our waitress - she took our orders and we waited. It was quiet in terms of other diners, however, not so quiet due to the noise from the staff. The staff were rather noisy at the front of house and up/down stairs.

But I am always disappointed when, for example, no vegetables are included in main courses and unforeseen service charge is added to the bill (in some cases not given to the staff). This means that a place is actually a good bit more expensive than you imagine when you first peruse the menu. Of course, I understand why some restauraters do it, but I think it's a pity and takes the customer for a bit of a mug. So, I prefer the system whereby all taxes and service charges are included in the advertised prices, as is the case in France. If you've received great service, by all means leave a bit extra for your server. But that's your choice.",4.0

We had the same menu and wines in the evening and I'd agree with all of that reviewer's comments - absolutely delicious, well-paired wines, generous menu, great value. The smiling, informative and relaxed service from the French waitress was excellent, but I would also agree with the various reviews pointing out that this restaurant is perhaps a little too busy - a few unusually long waits. Too many tables crammed into the available space. We sat in the middle of the restaurant and the gangway between the back of my chair and the large table just behind was slightly too narrow for the staff. My arms and the back of my chair were gently bumped or brushed more than five times during dinner. It didn't make any difference to my enjoyment of the meal or the evening, but it certainly created the impression that it is too crowded. Having said all that, if this number of covers is what is required to maintain such a high quality restaurant here then they shouldn't change it.

Not sure it was because we built up an appetite briskly walking there but we both thought we'd would have definitely eaten the other side of chips but went for the tirimisu which was also very good and an espresso martini (great way of getting customers to spend more) haha!

542,Q Verde,390759617,July 2016,"I wish there was a 'Good' rating on TA but am reasonably happy to be generous and give a Very Good, although not all aspects of our meal were. We were (quietly) celebrating my brother's birthday but sometimes found it difficult to have a conversation because the service was so very attentive and enthusiastic. I started with artichoke hearts stuffed with spinach and something else and these were fine. The calf's liver to follow was pink and delicious but the zucchini friti were a great disappointment. These should be very thin strips of vegetable in a light tempura batter but instead were thick pieces of courgette covered in what seemed like eggs and breadcrumbs. Very wrong. My green salad was mainly made up of tired leaves and cucumber with a mayonnaise based dressing that I didn't ask for. For dessert my brother and his wife asked for an Affogato, not on the menu but standard fare in most Italian restaurants. After a little hesitation it came in large coffee cups. My strawberry ice-cream was too sweet for my taste. Nit-picking? Yes a bit but with a little more effort this restaurant could be more than a 'neighbourhood Italian'. I suspect the ease with which it picks up Kew Gardens trade probably prevents that effort being made. It sounds like we had a horrid time. We didn't. It was actually a lovely occasion, but I'd think twice about returning.",4.0
543,Mezzet Lebanese Restaurant,593361164,July 2018,The food was fine. But the wait was unacceptable at lunchtime. For a two course meal we were over two hours.

However the restaurant is small, decor nothing to write home about, food hearty Italian and you won't leave hungry but doesn't have the finesse of fine dining. Wine list is limited at best. Apt recommendations by others as the candid neighbourhood Italian, stand out feature the welcoming owner and the zucchini frites. No cheese selection. Toilets by kitchen given space. Everything else is what I would call average. In an area surrounded by top notch eateries I am struggling to see why this one can't put on some of the same sheen as the glasshouse or Kew grill which have that special ambience.",3.0

Don't be put off by this as the restaurant itself is well decorated and very comfortable. The tables for 2 seem quite close together, requiring sotto voce if you are not to give away family secrets. As on every occasion the service was impeccable and the food delicious and beautifully presented. I particularly enjoyed the smoked eel starter. My lamb three-ways was the perfect colour but was a little underseasoned for my taste. The wine list is comprehensive and priced to suit all budgets.

Veal escalope was like eating cardboard so tough and insignificant and the calves liver was overcooked and swimming in liquid. The headwaiter ( or owner) had even suggested you like it pink.

Staff were ever friendly and helpful but somehow the atmosphere was not the same. Food was tasty and well presented but much reduced in quantity and more formal. At £25 per head (dearer than last time) it could have been better value. Cost didn't bother me, but receiving less food and paying more is never a good experience.

He comes and sits and talks and jokes with you and guides you thro' the menu. we selected the antipasto (i?) and a conglomeration of the menu's tagliatelle ragu and our particular Q Verde favourite; the Italian sausage.

Il patrone then rejoins one and of course we have some more excellent wine after the initial UK beers. Again an enormous platter of some of the most delicious concoction we had ever experienced.

Recent developments have been the specials board, although it doesn't change much it does offer something different to the main menu, and dishes I enjoy. The ravioli starter is usually ricotta and spinach, 2 large parcels; people might balk at just 2 but they are filling and satisfying - personally I could eat more but then that would not leave much room for the main dish. For the main dish I deviated from my regular dishes; for a veal escaplope most people would go for the Saltimbocca, but the Vitello Milano is a breaded escalople - Schnitzel Mailander Art - it was tender, fabulous. Hand cooked chips and zucchini were fried to perfection. Ambience remains civilised and good natured - even when Anna (not Italian) and Gerardo are not around things tick along perfectly well.",5.0

We had the artichoke starter, which was good as well as the spinach & goats cheese, mains of chicken with chilli was good, calves liver was cooked in too much butter. Desserts were adequate, tiramisu was disappointing. Coffee was good but £2 fir a single expresso you would expect that. The blow to us was the bill, it was handwritten and difficult to read, luckily I had on e menu that service charge of 12.5% would be automatically added! then when we came to pay by card we were asked to pay service charge again, when unasked the waitress didn't the bill already have charges added she said yes! but you can pay even more tip! I said I was disappointed with this practice she shrugged shoulders as it is a standard practice by them. I said I would not be considering coming back as this was bad practice she said its up to you and walked off.

Normally, for a set menu or limited choices for parties of, say, 12 persons or over (18 in our case) you wouldn't expect anything more than average but I was pleasantly surprised. With my choices made a few days in advance, I had chicken livers followed by roast smoked salmon and finished with tiramisu. Red and White Italian wines and sparkling mineral water were served with a liqueur and a coffee or tea to finish. The starter was, well, so-so, but the main salmon course was superb.

The chicken was excellent but I could not finish it. The menu is mainly lamb and chicken with one veal dish. There were vegetarian options. My partner had a chicken shish with rice and some of my chips. We were given a complimentary salad as well. For a sweet I had the rice with rosewater and pistachios which was excellent and my partner had the baklawa. We were also given some of the baklawa to take away, with the remainder of my baby chicken! The wine is good and reasonably priced. The service was good as well.",4.0

We ordered drinks, the beers came but not the bottle of wine ordered - little reminder, in the meantime the starters came (3 out of 4 anyway) less than 5 mins after ordering which was fine only the halloumi was cold and we were still eating starters with no wine - second reminder.! The 4th starter, when reminded we were still waiting for, was apparantely on its way, it finally came after we had finished our cold halloumi. It then seemed like a long time until we got out mains.

However, in a recent visit we noticed that standards had dropped significantly. It was early evening, a half full restaurant, lots of staff just started the evening shift but couldn't get any attention. Finally got a waiter to take our order but had to raise my hand after 40 minutes as we had not received our meal. In fact the table across from us arrived 20 minutes after we did and they received their meals well before. We would normally make allowances for these mistakes but instead we had a waiter with an attitude and no apology. The disappointment continued when the food arrived. In the past, the mixed grill was a favourite but what was on the plate did not resemble the usual dish. Instead we got a smaller portion of badly cooked meat, no mixed grilled vegetables and no sauces. What happened? Well, we'd say it's nothing special anymore.

A warm welcome when we arrived and we shared a delicious antipasti platter which was generous and freshly prepared. We all had either the veal cooked with lemon and rosemary or the liver, both of which were very well cooked, tender and full of flavour.

The decor is starting to look very worn, quality and portions of food are definitely less and the fantastic service that used to exemplify this restaurant was practically non-existent on our last visit. Looking through some recent reviews suggests this is a general trend. We waited over an hour for our main meals while other tables arrived and finished eating. A polite word with the manager resulted in the excuse that certain items on the menu take longer to cook. An hour? This was just nonsense as we'd ordered vegetable moussaka and grilled lamb cutlets. In the past I think the previous fantastic friendly service would have overcome this annoyance but the promise of being looked after following our quiet complaint was never fulfilled. Even just trying to pay and leave was a trial as we were constantly ignored by the many staff. I doubt that we will be going back anytime soon - if ever again.

Arrived early and was able to be seated almost immediately. The menu was varied with lots of delicious sounding dishes. I decided to go with some I had had previously in the Middle East as a point of comparison and my wife chose a little more conservatively. The food was AMAZING! Everything just had so much flavour, and I can attest to authenticity of the dishes. The service was excellent, we felt well cared for. Having feasted on far to many mezza, we decided it best we skip dessert however after asking for the bill, our waitress brought over 2 plates and a tray of baklawa and fruit, compliments of the restaurant on our anniversary! A gesture of this kind shows that the care and grace they take in the restaurant runs from booking to leaving, less a money making machine and more customer-centric and definitely concerned with upholding their good name and reputation. Well this evening, they did just that and we may very well have found our favourite new local restaurant.

Our waiter chatted to us, explained some things on the menu and helped us to choose some amazing dishes. The warm pitta is delicious and just keeps on coming - can't remember ever being to another restaurant in London where something gets topped up for free. Our waiter Fadi was lovely and kept making us laugh - his friendliness and openness made the whole experience more enjoyable. Also - make sure you order the baklava! We'll definitely be back!",5.0

It was lovely to have that level of hospitality to be able to accommodate any request. We ordered a few starters which were all fresh and full of flavor. My fiance does not usually like Italian as he says it's the same everywhere but he absolutely loved this restaurant and praised the food and service very highly.

From the mezze starters (best hummous!), through to the shared mixed grill, with tender chicken and lamb, and everything in-between, we loved every bite.

The welcome from the host is warm and friendly and very engaging. Staff are attentive and pleasant - head chef usually surfaces. One concern was that the menu was gettting a little long in the tooth, but it has been refreshed but the most noticeable change is the specials board, usuallly a fish dish, a pasta or meat dish and a starter. We are offered a mixed starter dish of parma ham, prawns, calamari, artichoke, melon, avocado, salami, olives and lettuce which is very satisfying. Bread sticks and bread are also provided. Main dishes, usually saltimboca (escalope) or fegato (calves liver), both heavenly. Plenty of choices for other palates, chicken, pasta, fish and vegetarian. Fish also well presented. Good wine and excellent beer. Special occasions catered for and a fuss was made for a birthday. Very enjoyable place to eat, no rush to make way for customers.

Again, the owner suggested bringing two large plates of mixed vegetables for us to share, and he included my favourite zucchini. Only a couple of us could manage desserts!

This is about our fifth visit and sadly we were disappointed. What we chose was well enough cooked and delivered flavour, but something was missing... my main was not very well balanced, it came with pasta (spatzle) and all with an intense sauce that was begging for some fresh light veg to balance. It was just too rich for my taste. The pommes purees we were offered were unnecessary and an odd pairing for pasta, or cassoulet (tarbais) beans and the other veg offered, brocoli in batter would not have worked. Sadly, our desserts had errors too; My cherry souffle though paired with ice cream and jam to make an elegant dish, was runny and undercooked. I pointed this out and was told 'this is how we serve it'. No apology or offer to replace the sweet. The other dessert was Choux au chocolat filled with dark caramel mousse with salted caramel truffle, it was billed as coming with ice-cream, which was not served, and it was also disappointing, the pastry dominating and the textures hard. I love this restaurant and I feel as if I am 'nit picking' but truly, when faced with a bill for £148 (one £25 bottle of wine, two aperitifs & a flight of beaume de Venise) for dinner for two, I would have expected more attention to detail The restaurant was packed!

1215,Q Verde,134498090,May 2012,"At school I was often asked,in written work, to 'contrast and compare'. In telling you about Q Verde, my favourite restaurant, I shall compare and contrast it with two others in London - Riva, in Barnes, and Joe Allen in Covent Garden. To illustrate my remarks I am using one classic dish beloved of meat eaters and scorned by vegetarians. That dish is Calves Liver. It is a simple dish requiring simple preparation and presentation. In Venice it is served with love. At Riva, in Barnes, it is served with arrogant indifference. In the herb business we live by the dictum 'less is more'. At Riva they smothered my poor Calves Liver in an autumnal coat of sage leaves. I asked for them to be removed and was told,""that is how we do it!"".

1220,Q Verde,138640793,August 2012,"This is a lovely friendly local restarant with great atmosphere. We first went with another couple for my birthday. The other couple were already there - but no one else. Having an absolute abhorrence of ""dead"" empty restaurants, I immediately had missgivings. As there was nothing we could do about it we were going to have to remain n o matter what, I could only hope it would fill up a little and after all, it was early. I need not have worried as within a short while every table had filled up and the the place was buzzing - greatly contributed to by the warmth and conviviality of ""mein host"". Not normally open the whole afternoon, Sundays are the one day when they are, so we recently ventured there for a late Sunday lunch. Again highly recommended and reasonable too. Food wise, this really does transport a part of Italy. The style and food is traditional italian, but probably the best version of it you'll be able to recall having. Most definitely worth a visit all round",5.0

1222,Mezzet Lebanese Restaurant,427080562,September 2016,"Booked this restaurant based in Trip Advisor comments as I wanted somewhere central for the extended family to meet up and celebrate my husband's birthday. The menu sounded very appealing and we all enjoy Mediterranean and middle eastern food. Needless to say, the reviews were spot on and we thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food and the surprisingly good Lebanese red wine. The Lebanese lemonade was a nice alternative for non-drinkers and really refreshing. We had some large plates of mixed meze to share, cold and hot, to start with. The food was fresh and tasty and went down a treat! The best part, though, was the surprise platters of fresh fruit and pastries that were brought to the table after we had finished our meals. These hadn't been ordered but the staff had realised it was my husbands birthday due to the cards on the table and brought them over, a lit candle in a baclava, whilst singing happy birthday. We were all a bit shocked but thoroughly enjoyed this complimentary touch. The food was superb and the staff were great too! Very good value for money bearing in mind the quality of the food. Only downside was the fact it took so long to find somewhere to park and then it was a long walk back to the car with an elderly father! Thank you,Mezzet, for a special birthday meal! We hope to come back soon.",5.0

Friendly staff including the chef who works the tables as much as he does in the kitchen.

I had Guinea Fowl for my main, my wife sole and both were well cooked with accompaniments and plenty of home made bread to mop up the tasty jus. we opted for carafes of house red and then finished the meal with delicious desserts - and they'd decorated the palters with another welcome message. All these nice extra touches made up to a perfect afternoon. we'll return and recommend others to try as well.",5.0

All the meals were lovely except the vegetarian offering - both the starter and the main were very small & bland was sadly told by my partner - he came with me for the company rather than the food as this place really does not do vegetarian food at all well. You'd expect a better and more creative veg option at Christmas than foam with mushrooms...Shame there is never a great offering for him though. I personally enjoyed my lovely presented guinea fowl and chocolate tarte.

We had intended to eat in Kingston but at last minute came back to Mezzet. The lovely waiter treated us very well and had a good mix of professionalism and cheeky banter- we also had another guy and young lady who tended to us and again both were very good with their service . I ordered a carafe of the Lebanese Sauvignon and would definitely do so again . We ordered the cold Mezze platter along with the labaneh and scallops and whitebait - all were faultless and a very enjoyable table of food . Unable to finish the labaneh it was boxed up for me to take home. The mixed grill was.shared and enough for the two of us after all the starters! Pitta bread was aplenty and so was the glass filling of the complimentary sparkling water. Again a lovely experience and reasonable cost .

To be honest, the place was full of happy, smiling punters, waving forks and going ""mmmm delish"", lots of parked push chairs and the loos were spotless.

Then I had the assiette of lamb, I have no idea how they could possibly get so much flavour out that lamb, it was intense! Now I'm not used to such rich food as those first two dishes so I nearly didn't have a desert, that would have been a mistake! I cannot even begin to tell you how good The morello cherry soufflé with pistachio ice cream was, it was absolutely incredible, out of this world!!

The management had packed in as many people as possible and it was awful We could nt hear each other at all speak all evening and could not have a single converstation without shouting at each other. The pop music and very high noise was intolerable. Eventually ordered food which was ok, I suppose. The fried prawns were tasteless however and burnt, the chicken and beef starter dry and horrid, and other items poor. The mezze was pleasant and we enjoyed that. I don't recommend the place at all the bill was quite high for what I can honestly say was the worst dining experience I have had since I went to a place 5 years ago. Don't go, unless its mid week and you don't mind high prices for average food. Lebanese it may be and trendy, but the management need to revisit the experience they give the customers.

Always made to feel so welcome and special on all my previous visits, especially by Fadi who was not here on this occasion. Walked through the door and took sometime to acknowledge me and then looking up my booking. Served by a waiter I had not seen before and clearly did not have the very special Mezzet service ethic. Fadi, you need to re focus on some of your current staff and their company loyalty, or your regular customers will start to lose the faith. This guy even had to be hurried up by his colleagues as he pranced around the resturant, seemingly slow and oblivious to his customers needs. Definitely not the class of waiters Mezzet has always had since their launch. He even forgot the Toubolie with the starters and we had to have it with the main.

1627,The French Table,270572220,April 2015,"A long term friend and ex work colleague had recommended this restaurant quite near the centre of Surbiton for a reunion style lunch. We had to book about 8 weeks ahead, but it was well worth the wait. Beside which two of the four dining still work, so timing was not easy. The lunch time menu is not large but offers choice of about 6 to 7 starters, mains and desserts. Reception was friendly, service also was very good only one choice of condiment had to be chased, otherwise not a foot was put wrong. The ambience of the room is good with a small bar and enough room between tables so you can a] hear yourself speak and b] not overhear other people. It is, as a matter of note, wheelchair friendly. We enjoyed our starters mostly rabbit and ham terrine and smoked mackerel. The main courses of lamb, stone-bass and the vegetarian option were very good and only needed one side order of mash and fresh vegetables between four, as there were vegetables in each course [lamb for example fresh asparagus]. The food was hot and beautifully cooked to bring out the flavours. All except one of us opted for the rhubarb duo and I will not describe it fully, as it was manna of the Gods- just try it! The wine list is massive and my first choice was not available but a very good substitute was found. Good strong coffee, and specialist teas followed. What a find, the owner/chefs are inspired and I will be back on an annual basis. My best meal for 19 months-EXCELLENT!",5.0

The selection is that of traditional favourites, all executed to consistently delicious quality. The choice of Lebanese wines is honest and tasty, you won't go wrong with the housewine, a robust and full bodied red which stands up well to the characterful food.

Freshly baked bread (you can have several pieces of the various bakes) as orders are taken from a proper menu. By proper menu I mean, catering for veggie, pescitarian and carne without having pages and pages of options. A chef who knows his kitchen and trade, clearly in evidence. 1 terrine and 2 fish starters with 50cl carafe of both red and white to suite the various palates and plates. I had the terrine. It was amazing. Rich, course, subtle and the piccalilli was sharp to offset it. Served with a house bread to accompany it. Feedback on the scallops was ""these are my favourite"" and the mackerel was ""well balanced"" with the rest of the plate. The bar had been set high for the main course. Wherein laid my only gripe. There was a private party in upstairs and the wait between starter and main was extensive, requiring a request to the kitchen to find it. Immediate apologies from various members of staff and the food soon followed. I had the special, lamb and the sauce was deep and rich with the line nuts and ground walnuts offset beautifully. The sea bream served on a bed of crab was ""exquisite"" and the cod was beautifully light. As a consequence of the delay, without any request, when the pudding menus were brought out, it was with the assurance that ""puddings are on the house to make up for the delay on he main"". I had the cheese for which I had 5 pieces with quince jelly, walnut bread and the little surprise of wild honey which was delicious against he more pungent numbers on my plate. Mother (birthday girl) had hers served on an elongated plate adorned with a chocolate happy birthday greetings and a candle. A nice touch to a delicious pudding.",5.0

Perfectly cooked and a good pork belly square to compliment. Then the fillet of beef. I had asked for it to be served blue. Oh dear. My companion had ordered the same dish medium rare - and his was perfectly cooked...sadly mine was even more cooked than his medium rare. I enquired with the waitress whether mine was indeed blue as requested to which she replied emphatically that it was.

I've been here many times, most recently December 2014. As usual we received a very warm and friendly welcome. We kicked off with delicious cocktails from the short and always-creative list, and some of the excellent in-house bread selection. All subsequent courses were as top-notch as usual. The signature main is the pork trilogie, meltingly soft highly flavoursome pork presented three different ways, which change from time to time.

We're not really that familiar with Lebanese food the waiter recommended the early evening set menu so we went for that. Definitely a good decision, our starters were a selection of 6, 3 cold, 3 hot. I can't remember them all but there was hummus, baba ganoush, stuffed vine leave, falafel, a hot pastry filled with a soft cheese. They were all delicious, even the humble hummus was quite a few notches above what we're used to. There was a choice between 3 main courses and so we had a chicken tagine and lamb kofte. The tagine was delicately flavoured and delicious and came with a large helping of couscous. The spice lamb kofte was also a generous helping and came with 2 dips - a spicy hot one and a cool one which I think had tahini in? We washed it down with a bottle of lebanese red that was lovely. We were the first people in the restaurant but it started filling up soon after we arrived. We were too full to try puddings but they brought us some small pieces of baklava anyway.

But from the service side alone I wouldn't return as I would expect far better from a restaurant of this standing. When we eventually made a complaint about having to wait so long we were told there was a party of twelve downstairs. Surely this shouldn't have created an issue for all the other diners.

He assured me it was very mild and that I could pour on as much or as little as I wanted, as it comes in a little jug - and he was right! It's great that the staff have clearly tried the food themselves and understand it. The portion sizes were sensible, not enormous but adequate.

The cooking here is right up there and we have never been disappointed. Even the bread ( baked on site ) is indistinguishable from its equivalent bought from a French artisan boulangerie. Worth noting too is the quality of the wine list and that none seem over priced. We enjoyed a great Pinot Gris Reserve from Alsace at c£30 which was an absolute steal.

I had a meal with friends there on a Saturday recently, it was packed as usual. But we had to wait 15 minutes for a menu! They didn't have enough! Surely the owner can afford to offer one menu per person? Or at least one per table?? Also when you order, do not I repeat do NOT order lamb. It comes in large squares and is so rubbery you could play football with it. It has even entered my head that it might be goat. I think they are buying cheaper cuts of meat, and it is just so bad.

We enjoyed a set menu, with many highlights worth mentioning, in particular Bream with Rice and Caramelised Onions, a dish which I am assured by Hamdi, our waiter for the evening, was one of his grandmother's favourites.

Such a huge menu to choose from it was difficult to decide, both my husband and I only eat fish and the choice was really good as there is also lots of pure veggie options; four of us on the table and we all had different starters and main courses - there was more than enough food! With no thought of dessert a sharing plate of mini baklava and fresh fruit appeared for us - which quickly dissapeared!

Depending on where you sit, it can be family fun or a romantic event for two people. The attention to detail is very good and the quality of the home made breads on offer, even though I prefer gluten free options, is worthy of a little cheat treat.

I definitely recommend the trio of lamb which was divine. For dessert we went for the assortment of cakes as we couldn't picked just one. It was scrumptious! The service was impeccable and we had a fantastic evening. Will definitely go there again as long as I remember to book a few weeks in advance.",5.0

We changed the time of our booking twice as we were running late, which the restaurant were happy to do. The dining room has a lovely relaxed yet sophisticated air; there seemed to be a number of family groups with well behaved children. We chose the three course menu which I believe was £23.50 pp - this was good value although the white wine we knocked back bumped the price up. The food was excellent and to quote my husband, the vegetarian, it is the first three-course vegetarian meal where he has enjoyed each course and felt comfortably full at the end. He had vegetable tempura, then a really tasty parcel (pastilla) of vegetables then I think a mousse. (Often going out for meals is a challenge and we resort to pizza or Indian because there is more choice for veggies.) I had a delicious breaded goat's cheese starter with beetroot hummus, then the special of confit duck, then an amazing chocolate dessert that had a crunchy base. I enjoyed each course and the presentation was particularly impressive. I would have taken photos only I thought it would have seemed uncivilised :-) The staff were polite and gave us lots of time to choose and browse the menu (we weren't in a rush so this was fine).

The tables are also far too close together. There's always upstairs which I tried last time I was there, but it was not an enjoyable experience since it lacks atmosphere and people talked in whispers!

The chocolate fondant for dessert was very nice, not too rich, but again not the best thing I've ever tasted.

2102,The French Table,183276753,June 2013,"I have no idea what you have to do to get a Michelin star but I reckon this place is well on course for it. We tend to go here for special occasions as it's not the cheapest night out, but as they say in the classics, you get what you pay for. The food is always an intriguing blend of styles and flavours, and whilst in most restaurants I can sit there and work out how something was made, in the French Table I find myself wondering how something was made because the skills required are well beyond someone like me. I have always gone for seconds or thirds on the bread basket and when they opened up a bakery next door I was over the moon. Their Chorizo bread is just gorgeous. I heard Gordon Ramsay saying complimentary things about this place and felt it was well deserved praise. Unflustered prompt service from friendly staff who are so far away from being the aloof types you'd expect to find in such a venue that there are a delight to talk to. I always think the portions are a little small,but always walk away feeling fulfilled. This is not the place for someone looking for a cheap night out, but the care and preparation that goes into every dish more than justifies the cost. Not the place to take the kids but for somewhere to share a perfect meal for two it can't be beaten",5.0
2103,The French Table,183306865,November 2013,Our table was so small that there was no room for a side plate or butter knife. We had to butter our bread while it was resting on the tablecloth.

Turning to the food it was very good. The steak was the best that I have eaten for years and the halibut was cooked to perfection. Service very pleasant.,4.0

Our meal was superb - the menu is mostlly chicken and lamb but there are fish dishes and vegetarian options also available. Our shared hummus was huge and when we had finished the flatbread they tried to give us more - we declined. For the main meal we opted for the chicken shish and luckily they had taken it off the skewer. It came with spicy roasted vegetables, a garlic dip and a sweet mint dip. In addition we ordered white rice which was perfect. Despite being full up I chose an ice cream sweet and ordered two of the flavours on offer - pistachio and vanilla with rose water. Wonderful!

2134,Mezzet Lebanese Restaurant,198102077,March 2014,"I am tired of writing reviews at length trying to understand why food service can be so bad. All the elements are here at this Restaurant, a good dining room pretty efficient staff and the ingredients used of a decent quality. I have looked at some of the reviews and there is a great deal of good will and loyal custom but in most of the reviews there is always something to forgive. The evening we dined here was an off night.We were sat at the worst table in the place. There were better empty tables but they were booked! a wait for our drinks got things off to a dodgy beginning. Starters too cold or tepid, under seasoned soggy batter on our calamari (chefs favorite). I was worried and started looking around, not many smiling faces so maybe not the only one with a problem. Mains a disaster. A waiter who uses a cloth to bring a hot dish to table with stone cold plates needs retraining. My friends tagine was like gruel with dry cold sawdust cous cous. Worst mistake was that she had had this dish a couple of times before so trying to say the runny soupy stuff served was how the dish should be was a mistake. My lamb was just warm on a plate from the fridge. My partners was well under-cooked. The waiter looked bemused and I detected a element of concealed frustration not with us but the food he was having to serve and I think that maybe this was not the first complaint. We made our concerns plain and dear of him the waited said we did not have to pay for our meal or drinks. We were then served baklava as desert and as an apology. This was appreciated but the fruit and baklava were frozen to the plate. We left with smiles but a great deal of disappointment. The last thing any of us wanted to do was to complain. My friend apologizing saying that it was so good on previous visits she can not understand why this has happened. Was the head chef and owner off this evening? Has the restaurant changed hands and the new owners not got up to speed? It is of little concern to me. What concerns me is that owners, chefs and waiters think that its OK to provide this kind of mediocre service.",2.0

We had no complaints about the food, especially the Wagyu Beef and assiete of desserts. However, the service was inattentive and it felt like as customers we were simply making up the numbers.

To follow the fish with white asparagus and crispy samphire. This was beautifully cooked and I had a shared side of mash and broccoli - the broccoli comes with a twist so please order it.

You can see the menu on the website but the Cornish crabmeat in a tuile and king prawn tail went down very well with our guests and the hot smoked salmon with cucumber sorbet was fantastic. Nouvelle-style can often leave you feeling it is inadequate but you won't find that here. Mains of crusted cod; assiette of lamb (3 ways) and trilogie of pork belly were all delicious; beautifully presented and cooked to perfection. We went extravagantly for dessert too; mille feuille of raspberries; tartelette of rhubarb and strawbs; creme brulee with earl grey tea ice cream - out of this world.

I'd never eaten Lebanese before so wasn't really sure what to expect. Well, I was in for a treat - enough to prompt me to write this review within 24 hours! The restaurant itself has a lovely,cosy yet bright feel to it. The lighting meant we could all see one another along the table and there was a natural buzz in the air as people chatted at their tables. We went for a set 3 course menu and the waiters were really accommodating, allowing us to tailor the set courses from the main menu to suit vegetarians/meat-eaters alike so that we all got plenty that we liked. The tapas style starters were incredible. Plenty for everyone and presented really beautifully, looking so appealing and fresh. We actually all ate a bit too much as it was so enticing! The main has worked its way into my own top ten of meals out ever! I took a chance on aubergine, roasted bread and pomegranate with yoghurt and rice. Absolutely incredible to the point it was hard to concentrate on the conversations at the table as I was so consumed with how amazing my dish was; delicate and fresh but really filling at the same time. The portions were fantastic. Again, there was plenty for everyone and the staff kindly bagged up the remainder to take home. The dessert was brought out as a sharing platter for the table - fresh fruit with gorgeous baclava type pastries and beautiful handmade chocolates. I truly didn't want to leave! The atmosphere and food were really special. I feel like we really found something quite different with Mezzet. A special mention needs to be given to all the staff. Over the course of the evening around 6 different staff collectively looked after us and the service was impeccable. They were such courteous, friendly, people who went out of their way to chat with us, provide for us and check on us without ever being intrusive. They really were wonderful and made our evening an absolutely brilliant one, going out of their way to ensure we were beyond happy.

The place is small but there is space between tables so your conversations remain private. It was v busy + the atmosphere was nice and lively but not overly noisy - although we were rather unfortunate to have 2 elder gentlemen drinking quite hard and being very loud. Service was exceptional without being obtrusive. Food was lovely - but i do notice that certain key ingredients are not mentioned on the menu. I detest custard (yes,even the posher version creme anglaise) - my dessert unfortunately had this in yet the menu stated - served with a white chocolate mousseline. I do think they should really not omit key ingredients as it can spoil a choice.They did kindly let me have another dessert. My starter of cheese souffle did not state it would be rolled in walnuts. Fine by me as i love these.I was warned it would be rolled in walnuts but if i had hated them or had a nut allergy, i would have to start my menu choice all over again. My fiance had the crab lasagne and was delicious. For main i had the beef rump and my fiance the lamb. They do assume you want these medium rare.

Although busy they said they would fit us in as best they could. When we arrived they had been able to reserve us a round table which was perfect. They really made us feel welcome and went out of their way to accommodate us. We shared the starter platter, which was lovely. Mains were steak, cod and calves liver. Great portions, beautifully cooked and lovely sides. Wine prices reasonable. My brother said Tiramasu was the best he had ever had. Lovely buzz in the restaurant, small but not to cramped.

2323,The French Table,142213858,October 2012,I have been here twice now and firstly I must say the food is delicious but and there is a but. On both visits the service was slow from the kitchen (we had our starter only in the first hour) and they seem to have difficulty serving the main with the accompanying vegetables. This time we had finished the course before they arrived and after i had to complain. They were very apologetic and made a generous reduction in the bill. But if i had wanted cheap food there are plenty of options. It spoiled the experience totally and with such nice food it's a real shame. They need to address this issue really quickly I'm in no hurry to go back although the food alone make it tempting. I agree with many reviews and maybe I was unlucky but twice........ Its way above the standard of most restaurants for food and many London ones could learn it must be close to michelin standard.Just make sure you want to spend about 21/2 hours for three courses and coffee. Delicious desert wines.,2.0
2324,The French Table,142756412,October 2012,"For those of us who'd rather not head into the centre of London for a good dinner, the choice tends to be a bit limited. The French Table redresses the balance. At £120 for two including a carafe of surprisingly good wine, it represents pretty good value for what you get. We got the small upstairs room. Less bustling, when full it is a pleasing enough space painted in the obligatory soothing grey. Two waitresses were rushed off their feet, but were always on top of things - if a bit too enthusiastic in delivering the service, a sort of breathless politeness that left this reviewer wanting them to try a bit less hard. As an aside, I couldn't see quite why it mattered that frogs legs had only been offered twice in the last 11 years. There was one serious service/cooking failure; the restaurant dealt with it properly, immediately and with genuine contrition - so full marks on that and it does not need relating.

The only possible explanations for 1 star are that the reviewers are either trolls or wouldn't know a decent restaurant if it ran over them!. Go with what the vast majority are saying and have great meal. Sunday lunch is very good value and you will need to book well in advance. Lots of nice touches like jugs of water on the table without asking and replenished automatically, also good selection of well priced desert wines by the generous glass, which is a bit of a rarity. Some people think it's noisy, it isn't. It's just people having conversations. I guess if you get parked next to some hoorays then that's irritiating, but hardly the restaurant's fault that some well off people don't know how to behave in public. When we were there, it was all very relaxed and amiable.",5.0

2393,Q Verde,242891560,November 2014,"Had a random dinner out here on a Tuesday last week. The owner is lovely - a very extroverted Italian! We had 3 x starters of Mussels, Squid and deep fried Gnocchi. The mussels were plump and juicy, not overcooked. The Gnocchi were very moreish with pesto in the middle. Squid was a little boring. For main I had prawn linguine (home-cooked) which was delicious, the prawns were slightly chargrilled which gave them a delicious smoky flavour. The others had liver (bleurgh - no comment) and chicken rigatoni which was very nice and creamy although a slightly small portion I thought. Wine was good, Italian (obviously). Will definitely be coming back as it's hard to find really good local Italian restaurants anywhere in London. Not necessarily the place to go if you don't want interaction with the staff but great for a group of friends",4.0

He clearly enjoyed his job as did his colleagues. I was really struck by how well everyone seemed to work as a team. We'd heard that portion sizes were small but can only assume that's an out of date criticism that has been rectified - we were stuffed when we left! In summary, a lovely restaurant with great staff.

This was our first Lebanese dining experience and we could not have chosen a better place to try Lebanese food. The staff could not have been more helpful and the service was outstanding. We had hot and cold mezze starters to share, which were delicious. The lamb and mixed grill main course were equally well presented and tasty and washed down with the house white and red wine. Deserts were skipped so can't comment on these but would expect nothing less that the quality of the rest of the food and wine to be maintained., though we did have a coffee. All in all and excellent restaurant which we would recommend without hesitation. We suspect you would need to book at the weekends as even Thu night was throbbing.

I ordered the belly of pork, only to discover when it arrived that it was served in three different ways, one of which tasted like a sausagemeat pattie in a greasy bun. The brocolli was coated in a chickpea flour and was a real non-event and the mashed potato was crying out for some seasoning.

2469,Mezzet Lebanese Restaurant,149282761,January 2013,"We decided to spend the day last Sunday in Hampton court and in the afternoon wandered down to the local shops where we came across this fantastic lebanese restaurant. The atmosphere was vibrant and the waiters were friendly, young and knowledgeable. They recommended for us to go for the mezzet option which is a selection of hot and cold starters like humus, tabbouleh, stuffed vine leaves. The food was so delicious and the ingredients were so fresh that you can easily compare to a Jamie Oliver kind of cooking. This was followed with even more delicious hot starters like filled fillo pastry with cheese and some with meat. For main course we selected the mixed grill which came with a good selection of Mediterranean grilled vegetables. The meat was soft and very tender. The wine selection is equally impressive and very reasonable, we chose the musart red wine which went very well with the meal",5.0

The table linen was immaculate but any suggestion of over formality was belied by staff who were friendly, helpful and efficient. The complementary bread was varied (chorizo, olive, gruyere cheese were three options) and plentiful as well as tasty and got things off to a good start. Sunday lunch was a set price three course meal. My ham and prune terrine starter with walnut break included a good mix of flavours with chunky pieces of meat whilst my panache of fish main came with a delicious risotto, and included haddock and scallop. The chocolate duo dessert kept the high standard of food going. My companion was equally happy with goats cheese starter, grouse main and pear gateau with poached pear for dessert.

As the restraurant is so popular I was only able to book a table for 9.15pm despite booking 10 days in advance; very obligingly the staff offered to let me know if there was a cancellation earlier in the evening, telephoned a few days prior to the booking to confirm I was still coming and let me know on the day that there had been no cancellations. I am not surprised it was both hard to book and there were no cancellations as we had an absolutely delicious dinner - having got a reservation no one in their right mind would give it up again! We each had a different dish from the varied & interesting menu, and all 9 (3 starters, 3 mains and 3 deserts) were all first class. Especially pleasing was the attitude of the staff; we met 3 or 4 different staff members, and everyone was as polite, charming and helpful as the next - none of the rather surly/snooty attitude one sometimes encounters in restraurants enjoying a good reputation. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff really appeared to both to enjoy their work.and take justifiable pride and interest in the food they were serving. Again, unlike some restraurants offering such high quality fare, the wine was not extortionate - very pleasant house wine @ £16.95 a bottle. I'll definitely be back and the sooner the better!",5.0

On being seated we were given an extensive wine / drinks list and the menus, the choice seemed endless! We chose quite a lot from the menu and did expect the food to come at different intervals through the evening, this was not the case, the food seemed to keep coming, at one point our whole table seemed to be covered in so many different dishes of food, we didnt know where to start. We had the cold mezze taster, this was really delicious, we also had a lamb dish and king prawn dish, lots of flat breads and pickles and dessert, everything was tasty and the house wine was also of a good quality.Even though we had eaten enough to burst we still managed to squeeze down desserts again we could not fault a thing. The waiters were very attentive refillling glasses of wine or water and happy to explain what certain dishes were. It was a welcome change to be served and tended by staff that were happy to do their job and did it well. Even paying the bill was quick and easy, no waiting about for ages trying to get a waiters attention, which so often happens at even the best rated restaurants.

We ordered a selection of small dishes, which were all fabulous in taste and presentation. We lost track of how many and one failed to come. When we got the bill, we pointed this out to one of the staff, who was very apologetic, realised immediately that we had not been served this dish and took it off the bill without further discussion.

Staff very attentive and helpful they advised us on the amount to order as basically the menu is so extensive that we were unsure of portion sizes. In the end we ordered just enough to fill two hungry people. We ordered lots of different meze dishes rather than go for a main course - that way you get to taste more. My particular favourite was the scallops - Fadi's favourite' and now mine - really delicious. We also went with a cold and hot mezze starter - I preferred the cold one to the hot as there were a few pastries in the hot which I am not that keen on. We also had vine leaves, tabbouleh, sesame prawns (also delicious) and lots of others that I have now forgotten. Wine wise we were recommended a lebanese wine which was absolutely delightful and went perfectly with the food. Coffee and brandy was our dessert as we were too full to eat anything else.

We were looked after very well indeed by the staff, who were on hand to describe menu entries for those of us less familiar with Lebanese food. As for the food itself, the starters were just extraordinarily delicious, and you could tell that the freshest ingredients are being used. Tabbouleh and Fattoush are highly recommended, but make sure you save some space for the main courses, which are just as good, if not better! It was lovely to be able to enjoy our food in such an ambient, cosy, and understatedly classy setting. I haven't been so content with a restaurant in the Hampton Court area for a while.

We have tried to book before but it gets busy - so book early! It was our 21st wedding anniversary so we wanted to try a different local restaurant. As we were both not drinking following the Xmas excess, we chose the Lebanese Lemonade - this was excellent and very well presented and we didn't miss the alcohol at all! We shared two starters between us - the Hommus and Sambousek Cheese. There was plenty of hommus for both of us along with different types of bread. The 2 parcels of cheese each were also a good choice. I chose the Lamb Meshwi from the fired grill. This was tender pieces of spiced lamb, nicely presented on a small bed of roasted vegetables with a yogurt and mint dressing and I think it was a sesame/tahini dressing in little dishes on the side. This was a very good choice for me. My husband chose the Mini Chicken and Lamb Shawarma. If you like a lot of meat, this is a good choice, but I preferred my Meshwi. The different meats come in a sort of edible pastry type cup with a decorative salad garnish. We also shared a mixed salad which had a tasty dressing and lovely soft feta cheese. I think if you chose the Shawarma you definitely needed the salad, as it would have been a bit plain without it. We didn't have room for a pudding as we were full, but we did get a complimentary dish of baklava - probably as they knew it was our anniversary and our first visit. We enjoyed our meal very much. The restaurant was very busy with a good atmosphere. We were given a nice table. The service by our waiter, and the manager was excellent.

I had 2 x small pita breads, 2 x small pieces of chicken and one small kofta and it worked out at £50 per person including wine ( to be fair we did have a few bottles of wine which itself was not that expensive ).

I liked the fact that the waiter guided us on a couple of dish selections when we were looking to perhaps spend more money - he didnt push or up sell. The Lebanese House White went perfectly with the Mezze selection of starters. Presentation of food was elegant and tasted great. Definitely will visit again soon. Staff were all friendy and polite a real pleasure to dine there.",5.0
2532,Mezzet Lebanese Restaurant,140434159,September 2012,I have been to Mezzet a few times now. I love Lebanese food and have experienced top class authentic middle eastern food in Jordan and the food at Mezzet is as good as what I had there. I think the food is excellent and this teamed with friendly staff and lovely Lebanese wine and cocktails (check out the Phonecian Lemonade) makes for a fantastic restaurant in my book. Actually the Lebanese wine surprised me. It's really good. I've been to both Levant and Momo in London and Mezzet is better in my view. It's brilliant to have such a good restaurant out in the sticks.,5.0

The food that was cooked for my partner was over cooked and I think you could have gotten a better piece of cod in a takeaway..., so all in all for the price we paid it was not value for money both for the ambiance and indeed the food.This is a great shame because our prior visit was excellent and we were so happy with the whole experience",2.0

The place was buzzing! The staff were attentive in the main and the food was excellent and at a fair price. We also thought the drinks were quite reasonably priced too. We had a very pleasant evening. The only two not so good things i could say were that we waited along time to get a drink but they were extremely busy and the smoke alarm went off (well they do when you cook kebabs!!) but everyone was goog spirited and there was a round of applause when they finally got it off.

It had joyous ambience and nice little touches of crackers on the tables, which guests entusiastically pulled, then wore silly hats and read bad jokes, and gave their plastic toys and puzzles to children at neighbouring tables.

2616,The French Table,478205319,April 2017,We have been many times to this restaurant and always really pleased with the food but last night was not up to the usual standard. We chose the taster menu which we usually have which is £52 a head. The crab course only had crab that was no bigger than a 10p piece ! The course with monkfish wrapped in bacon was very dry and the sweet course that usually has several small puddings to share consisted of a small plate of pear helene. Usually every mouthful is a delight but it wasn't like that last night. What has happened to my favourite restaurant ? It is not a cheap meal and I will think twice about returning in the near future,3.0

This is a lovely friendly neighbourhood Italian, quite chic too (well, this is Kew!). For starters we shared some colourful platters of antipasti and prosecco. For main I had Saltimbocca (veal with sage, parma ham and mozzarella). We all shared vegetables including zucchini fritti. The steaks also looked good and the calves' liver was excellent, I'm told. For dessert, they came out with a special dessert for the nephew and I couldn't resist the tirami su. This place is perfect for a celebration or a romantic dinner for two.

A handy tip to note is that they will do platters of mixed antipasti on request (not on the menu), and they are very good. I get the distinct impression that whoever sources their ingredients is a perfectionist, as the Parma ham is possibly the best I've ever had. The home made pasta is also worth checking out - particularly the home made ravioli. Tiramisu is also very good - and it's so light.

Each course was exceptionally tasty, well-cooked and presented. The ingredients went together well and wine matchings were spot on. Portion sizes were quite sizeable for a tasting menu, only marginally smaller than items on the à la carte menu, particularly the dessert, a delightfully light chocolate tart with a range of flavoursome raspberry accompaniments - nothing short of divine.

However just recently ( and hopefully temporarily ) the standard seems to have slipped a bit. The Moutabal had no flavour ( due to undercooked aubergine perhaps) and the main dish was dry plain ingredients with no sauce to make it into a dish. The artichoke hearts were too vinegary and the chef appeared to have a positive mania for fried / caramelised onions which obliterated the flavours of the other ingredients and appeared in several dishes.

Service was on e again great, but the lady owner could spare half of the visitors a scene where she was shoutinng at staff without any particular reason. Also what you can notice - you will be last person served if usual guests are in as these seem to be on priority list. Its quite expensive though, but its worth to try.",4.0

Italian menu - delicious pasta, meat, veg and pud. All amazing at very good value considering where it is located near Kew Railway Station with one or two top restaurants nearby. Recommended? The liver definitely; so thin and still pink, pan fried in white wine and sage. Also the veal escalope. Their pasta starters just melt in your mouth. I wanted a lot more!

The ambiance in the back room isn't that great, but the warmth and attentiveness of the staff balances it out. We both opted for a starter from the specials board of white crab and avocado, which was sublime. I then stayed with the specials board and had monkfish in a cherry tomato sauce - it is the best monkfish dish I have ever had the pleasure to eat. My partner has the scallops and pancetta, which again was very good. Unusually, we decided to go for a sweet - due to the high quality of the previous dishes we wondered how special their puddings would be. And 'oh wow'. I had the tiramisu, which was lovely, but the star of the show was the orange and chocolate cake - absolutely delicious and so light. We've relived that meal times since we've been back home and we will absolutely be going back when next near Kew. Oh and by the way, the chef comes round and makes sure you are happy with the meal - nice touch and not done so much these days. Well done Q-Verde.",5.0

Precise French Cooking, brilliant service, lovely ambiance, fair pricing and buzzing with people's anticipation of the treats that were to come. An oh, the bread,!! Baked on the premises, but do watch out. You must restrain yourself from eating too much for fear of getting full. So back to my main point: I wish there were more local restaurants like this.",5.0

3236,Q Verde,706027795,November 2018,"We had reserved a table for a name's day celebrations. We arrived happy and excited and on time with one bouquet of flowers and our table was half ready(missing half of the glasses, napkins, menus etc.) we asked if we can please put flowers in a vase and the waiter/owner said we have nothing and then we asked again and he gave a dry wine bucket stand and we asked to put some water if possible, he was grumpy about it. Also, we were left sitting at half ready table with our coats on, even though they were asking all the other guests if they want theirs taken to be hanged. That was a red flag, then we ordered some food and my sister glanced at the waiter and he straight away asked, with an attitude, what are you looking at?. At this point we starting to feel it might have been a mistake to come here. Long story short - We had 3 waiters change, orders were mixed up or forgotten, we had to chase them almost every time as they wouldn't stop at our table. Food - veal liver was under cooked and extremely greasy, mussels had actual rocks in them and they said it's ok don't worry, we wash them, when i complained about it twice... they didn't offer nothing even though i was clearly dissatisfied. Mains were decent but it was just pasta and desert was store bought and not cooked on the spot so was ok. Owner was walking and asked how everyone is except us for some reason? Maybe he needs to see you twice to show Italian hospitality? Before we were leaving he finally asked is all good and gave limoncello. The bill was not readable and seemed more than we expected around £150 for 3 adults 1 kid. One of the worst restaurant experiences ever, for that money we could've went to The Glasshouse (Michelin restaurant at Kew station) and would have been treated like humans and not like we shouldn't be there. I really don't understand how they get their high score! Arrivederci to Never Again. It's a shame though..",1.0

I found his mannerisms extremely poor, doubting he had any hospitality training at all. My husband was brought the wrong main course (chicken instead of lamb) and when queried, he made out as if he ordered the wrong item and then tried to sway us from bringing the correct dish by over exaggerating on the time it would take to bring the correct dish.

Over the course of the evening the restaurant got busier (a good thing), but our mains took near on 50 mins to arrive. And when they did, oh dear. Had to send back 2 of the 4 back as not up to standard. That was proven when the replacement dishes of the same order arrived - much better cooked. So another or a new chef/more training is required too. Plus some quality control before dishes leave the kitchen. We did speak to the manager who kindly comp’d a starter and main from the bill.

The food was exceptional. Truthfully I expected it to be slightly above average, but it was quite a few notches up from that. My wife went for the grilled cauliflower and truffle cream which was beautifully presented and was as tasty as it looked. The prices were also really good.

The staff are really well trained and on a busy Christmas Eve they dealt brilliantly with drinks orders, extra drinks, food etc. Can't fault them. The place itself is an old pub, very little parking, scrubbed tables and Farrow and Ball type decor, just like our local branch which is a regular favourite. Everyone in a party of six had good food, except me. I stupidly ordered the paella, my favourite. But of course it was as poor as our local one, gritty, dry and only mild flavour.

However it tasted very good. For the maincourse I chose the mango and crayfish salad and it was really very good indeed . Especially with a side of sweet potato chips which were excellent. Only two of my group chose deserts and both were disappointing. My raspberry cheesecake was served in a traditional champagne ‘coupe’ which again was difficult to eat and lacked flavour.

My rigatoni ragu was nicely cooked, though more than two little pieces of beef might have indicated a greater generosity of spirit. The Nero d’avola was big hearty wine at a big hearty price, but hey that’s SW6. However where Gola and I part company is in its mismatch between the two hour booking slots and the sclerotic service.

3659,Madhu's,262600672,March 2015,"Visited on Friday evening as I wanted to experience indian fine dining and have to say I was disappointed by the experience. We were seated by the bar where waiters stood chatting the whole evening which spoilt the atmosphere. My side plate had an eyelash on it. The cutlery looked like it was suffering from wear and tear. My husband's napkin was taken out of the napkin holder and placed on his lap..my napkin had no holder and my napkin was left on the small plate for me to put on my lap. Service very hit and miss. On seating the waiter suggested a beer to my husband and gave him a Cobra which wasn't to his liking... My husband then asked for a Carling beer and this was poured into his glass whilst he visited the gents! Food was not brilliant, quite bland for my liking. Fish starter was good and so was the mixed grill. The main course portions were too much for two people. Keema mutter was very dry and didn't seem fresh. The chicken curry was ok. Not sure about the choleh dhal - the dhal was not cooked well and the pieces of dhal were hard when chewing. The naan were fine. If this is fine dining then service should be perfect and professional and cutlery and plates should be clean. My plate had grey lines on it (probably from extensive scrubbing or something). I'm not sure that I would rate this restaurant as fine dining. The staff certainly didn't depict that at all. It reminded me of a fast food restaurant and certainly was no different to a desi darka. When I visited this restaurant 7 years ago there was a certain air of fine dining and quality in both the food and and service, which it certainly lacked it on this occasion. I think that you are trying to cater for the average guest.",3.0

I don't know what has happened since then, but the standard of service has dropped to inexcusably poor levels for a premium and very pricey restaurant, we found waiters to be pushy and just want us to order drinks which we don’t want, I requested a masala papad but with finely chopped salad and I was told they cant do it, without even asking the chef , I consider this to reflect an appalling lack of flexibility and attention to the individual customer's needs in the context of a premium southall restaurant, food was avarage and no one had a word of praise except for the Boozi Bafu and Machuzi Kuku were excellent.",1.0

We had the steak, mussels and fish curry and all were delicious and came out piping hot, fresh and cooked beautifully. We followed up with desserts and chatter and wine.

Greeted by very friendly staff & shown to our table at the back of the restaurant. Service continued to be excellent- friendly, efficient yet unhurried. Starters came out very quickly - chicken liver parfait with red onion marmalade & toasted brioche was extremely tasty, boyfriend enjoyed beef taco wrap. As it was a birthday, we decided on the chateaubriand to share which was very well cooked & melted in the mouth, it was just a real shame all the sides were priced separately as the mixed leaf salad just wasn't big enough to feed both of us & wasn't good value for money. We ordered the Baked Alaska for dessert which I was really looking forward to but sadly it missed the mark on taste. The sponge inside was hard not nice & springy as it should be & it really would have benefited from having strawberry ice cream rather than chocolate inside & the cointreau poured over the top didn't add anything. The wine, although very tasty, was grossly overpriced hence I only stretched to one glass, boyfriend's beer was normal price which was fine. When I booked online, I followed up my booking with an email explaining it was my boyfriend's birthday & could anything be done on the day to make it special but sadly this wasn't noted on the booking. Toilets were clean but there was an unusual rather unpleasant smell up the stairs that led up to the toilets, this needs addressing I would say.",4.0

3711,The Andover Arms,392261141,July 2016,"I first came to the Andover Arms in1976 and fell in love with the concept of food at lunchtime with a pint. In those days you looked at the behind the glass offer of shepherds pie, fish pie or the beloved ploughmans lunch (bread cheddar chutney and a sausage for the uninitiated or those who remember). Welcomed by the landlord / landlady in a pub seemingly so small yet Even when packed. A secret then and still now. Now is now 2016 and as a local for the last 20 years it remains a unique unspoilt place which I love introducing to friends from all over the World. Why? Because the charm and uniqueness remains and the food offer has resplendently altered over the years while retaining that unique feeling of history that only a few London pubs retain. Always 5 stars plus for me but then I am biased. If you want great food and real London pub vibe just go and have a pint and I bet you stay for food, make friends and keep coming back. I do.",5.0

The ambience and setting was great as we privatised the restaurant. We had a few speeches and even without a microphone everyone could hear.

3763,Madhu's,234046697,October 2014,My Wife and I went for dinner on Saturday night a week ago. Reserved table at 09:30 and were left hanging at the door for 30 minutes. Finally given a table near the staircase and lots of unruly kids screaming and playing on the staircase. Ordered salted Lassi and got a drink full of salt in it. Next came the sparkling water with no gas in it.. tottaly flat. Waiter tried to educate me that sparkling water never has any gas in it and saleted Lassi means extreme amounts of salt with yoghurt. Manager was no we here to be seen. Insisted on replacement drinks but am sure the same Lassi and bottle of water were returned to my table as new. Ordered Chili chicken as starter and all I got was bones of chicken with very little chicken. To cap it all the methi chicken and Karai Ghost were full of salt.. I think the head chef at Madhus has serious issues with salt and food and the restaurant was totally shambles with kids running around complimented by clueless staff. Will never go back there,2.0

We had a sharing platter of cured meat, burrata, pizza bread, melted caciocavallo cheese, seafood linguine as main course and white chocolate cheescake. The food was great and as I am from Puglia I can surely say that the burrata was really good, fresh and with a real taste. The pasta was served a bit cold but was tasty and really good. The cheescake was simply divine. The staff and the owner are really friendly and welcoming providing a great service and customer care. Worth it!",5.0

It was for lunch and it turned into an enormous success thanks to the quality of the food and the excellent unfussy service. You can't believe that this very ordinary looking pub in a west London suburban street can offer such an excellent menu combined with enormous portions. The food isn't standard pub fayre but a well thought out menu with something for everyone's tastes. As other reviewers have pointed out the shoulder of lamb portion size is OTT and certainly defeated all those in our party with a consequent canine feast. The atmosphere is informal and friendly and the staff really enjoyed what they were doing. A great find! Parking was easy at a weekend.,5.0
3873,The Andover Arms,353411594,March 2016,"We had Sunday lunch here and it was absolutely delicious. We both had the half lamb shoulder. Word of warning it is enormous, perhaps worth sharing the lamb and another roast as we both had the lamb and it was far too much food for both of us. Wonderfully cooked and lovely gravy, roasties were nice and crispy too. Yorkshire pudding was a bit on the crispy side but not really an issue. Incredibly well priced for the amount of food and drinks were reasonable too. They did overcharge us for the lamb but quickly rectified this when pointed out however they do add 12.5% service charge, which is fine, except they manually took off the extra they added on for the lamb but did not adjust the service charge.

3892,The Andover Arms,330828275,November 2015,yes they do serve lovely home style food .. but not outstanding based on reviews before. All of our dishes were good ... the problem with this pub is that it is not very central and akward to get to .. Hammersmith tube about 10 mins walk via a lot of back streets ... and not worth really the taxi ride we paid to go there from Gloucester Road. Think ranking is too high on TA based on recent experience and TA cards sitting on tables to prompt people to go home and review them.

Mr Food had what he considers to be the best lamb shank in central London. The lamb was cooked to perfection and peeled off the bone with ease. A very tasty lamb indeed. The roast veg was also worth forcing down after the hefty portion of meat. Unfortunately, Ms Wine's roast beef was served cold while the veg was still piping hot. The great customer service was demonstrated through immediately tending to the problem and bringing her back hotter roast beef. However, the roast beef was still nothing special. The portions were so big that we almost didn't have any space for desert. But we ordered it and took whatever was left of it home in a doggy bag. The apple and berries crumble with custard was delicious, particularly loved the fresh berries. Less-than-satisfactory roast beef aside, everything else was very impressive.",4.0

I visit as often as I can despite the fact that the restaurant is over 40 miles drive from where I live. The quality of the food is exceptional, as is the service, with a well trained and enthusiastic team headed up by their very professional maitre d', Ajay. The atmosphere is also very good with a vibrant buzz created by the diners and not relying on piped music. It always seems to be busy which speaks volumes in post recession Britain, particulalry with the quality of the many competing restaurants in this area. Centre stage of course is the food and over the years I have visited a number of Indian restaurants, regulariy writing reviews for the Good Curry Guide, and I would say that this is the best Indian food I have ever tasted. I also work for a food company myself so tasting food is a major part of my job, but it is difficult to describe the food at Madhus because the flavours are so perfectly balanced, with nothing sticking out (except of course when it's supposed to e.g. the excellent Jeera Chicken which tastes strongly of cumin because it's supposed to!). Everything I have tried on their extensive menu has been great but personal favourites are King Prawn Achari, Nyamh Choma (very unique spicy and tangy lamb ribs) and Aloo Papri Chaat for starters, the mighty Dal Makhni (best lentils I have ever tasted anywhere), Buzi Bafu (another unique Madhus signature dish with lamb chops in a rich spicy sauce), Allo Raviya (potato and aubergine curry) and Keema Mutter (minced lamb and peas), to mention but a few.

We have also attended special tasting events, such as one courtesy of Madhu's and Diageo, which were terrific.

Now the food, my starter Mushroom Tartine or fungi on toast with a perfectly poached egg. I know it sounds like a New Zealand breakfast but it was so tasty. Then the fish pie with green beans and broccoli. Simply delicious and comforting, just want was needed as we all braved the beast from the east (a cold snap). Apart from the taste, for me the other stand out was the temperature of the food. Piping hot beans and broccoli yet the pie which so often can burn the inside of your mouth until the skin hangs off, not here - it was perfect. For me that shows a kitchen where the chefs really care about their food. All in all a great value delight. I will be back hopefully with Becca and the Girls.",4.0

We visited on a Thursday evening (8.15pm booking) and it was very busy - It probably always is as it is very popular and has mostly good ratings. It is a Pub with a Bistro stuck on the side so it does have a very noisy/rowdy pub atmosphere, which spoilt our enjoyment a little as we had to shout at each other to be able to hear. Also, we were sat near an exit door that was opened a lot and made our table area very cold indeed, with us all getting an icy blast every time - most unpleasant indeed. The chairs are not very comfortable - more padding needed! Considering the style/environment we felt prices were too high - I had a lovely Fishcake but is was £13.50 and an extra £3.50 for Chips plus £3.25 for Salad so £22.28 with gratuity included for a very simple meal.

An un-British smoked salmon with Tequila sauce as an appertizer was delicious, followed by traditional pub fare meat pies and such. Dessert was a wonderful raspberry crumble. We were already stuffed but couldn't resist. We were probably the only tourists there, but were warmly welcomed. Ambiance was cozy and homey, clearly a local favorite - some even with their dogs, albeit small and well behaved ones who sat beneath the tables. We totally enjoyed our time there.

I ordered the roast beef as part of the Sunday roast menu and it was quite simply the best restaurant roast dinner I have ever had. For 15.80 plus 3.50 for dessert this was amazing value for money. They did really well to accommodate our three children and we all had a lovely time. Our waitress (Elle / Ella?) was brilliant and nothing was too much trouble.

The chef, Angelo, is a creative master of the kitchen, a culinary genius - and the owners - Aaron and his wife - are passionate, engaging and friendly, but with the smoothness and charm you'd want from the owner of such a fine Trattoria....they really do treat everyone like special ""VIP""s...like cherished family.

Arrived 10 minutes early for a table reservation for two early Sat evening, and were turned away from a virtually empty dining room to the packed bar to stand and wait for a drink. Eventually guided to a cramped table in the corner of a soulless dining area in between the bar and the restaurant proper which was disappointing as we had made advance reservations. Politely asked if we could be accommodated somewhere else and the disgruntled manageress reluctantly showed us to another table that was unoccupied when we originally arrived and barked that we would have to leave within two hours. Lovely welcome! Then one of our three different waiters advised us that several of the menu items were unavailable. Very poor on a Saturday night at 7pm. Although there are daily specials, the menu has remained unchanged since opening and is now very predictable and lacklustre - or as we found out not actually available. Our starters were embarrassing and consisted of a tiny square of a grilled smoked salmon fillet ( brown scrappy end) and a circle of raw cauliflower florets dipped in freezing horseradish and one piece of beetroot - all for £8.50 - mains of suckling pig and the cheese desert were okay, but really mediocre at best. The staff were very nice and helpful but the atmosphere ruined from the start. Simply for the price there is much better on offer in Weybridge and a friendlier welcome.",1.0

The food was just amazing. We ordered four roast dinners between us (pork, chicken, lamb, beef) and the meals definitely showed my Japanese in-laws how good British cooking can be (British cuisine has a pretty bad rep in Japan!). My wife and sister enjoyed Pimms and cider, and I quaffed three of the ales there. All excellent. Finished off with sticky toffee pudding, chocolate brownie (or cake?) and Eton Mess.

Wasn't very romantic at all. The ambiance wasn't great either, very loud, felt like I was in a canteen.the food was ok, pretty standard. I ordered a paneer jalfreezi for my main and requested extra garlic and spicy. The waiter said it was hot and if I wanted a madras hot then I could have that. Seen as he said it wad hot I opted to have it as it was. When it arrived it couldn't have been more mild!!! I had 2 large glasses of wine and when my bill came it had a price of £4.50 and £5. I questioned it as a matter of principal only to be told there was a mistake in the price and the cost was £5 for a large glass. I wasn't questioning it because of the extra 50p it was because this should have been checked properly. Overall food was ok and service was good. Wouldn't go back again.

The food was excellent, three of us had the turbot and two the fish and chips, all had starters.

Actually, “pub grub” doesn’t do it justice because the food is extremely good and more restaurant than pub, however the menu choice is what you’d expect.

First, it's location hardly betrayed the fact that you were within one of the biggest cities in the world as we felt we were in a peaceful village with the locals having a pint. The décor was what an American envisions in a classic pub and the service was friendly, genuine, and excellent. And we were absolutely thrilled with the dinner we had (lots of traditional grub pub with a modern twist as well as some non traditional items), so much so that when our dinner plans two nights later got scuppered, someone suggested returning to the Andover Arms, a notion that was quickly accepted by the rest in our party of eight!

Everything is served with appealing flair. Aaron, the owner, assures super fresh food is prepared as it is ordered. Last night we had Taggliattia (filet steak) with porcini (mushrooms) that was delicious. Always leave room for the generous, fresh, made-on-the-premises desserts; zeppola is a Chantilly-type cream and strawberries on a pastry that you could never make yourself!

If you have a party of 5, try to order all dishes from the Sunday Roast option, including vegan option too, because it tastes good. As I have mentioned before, the most astounding thing is Shoulder of Lamb. Also, there are a wide range of Beers and Ales, so don't be shy and use the wide knowledge of waiters in the secrets of british liquids.

4192,The Andover Arms,280479634,June 2015,Before writing this review I have read at least 30 others and I have found one that summed this situation up perfectly. This is basically a pub with slightly above par food which has probably received some good reviews and has then snowballed out of control. I was booked into Gordon ramsay new restaurant maze grill but as I was nearer this place decided to go there. What a mistake!! The food was terrible. I had lamb shoulder which was a monstrosity on a plate!! It was allegedly slow cooked but rock hard on the outside and no pink at all in the centre. The mash was far too heavy almost like microwave mash. The dish was so heavy and large i was instantly put off by it. Anybody who rates this place highly does not understand good food. It was something you would get from a hungry horse for 1/4 of the price. £60 for two people for that rubbish was insane. My friend had bubble and squeek which tasted decent but again oversized and was like a side dish served as a main. He complained it was so dry a d tastleless. I thought maybe the eggs on top were for moisture but they were o er cooked with no runny yolk?? Would never return and hope people will not jump on the bandwagon as they could have much better food almost anywhere!!,1.0

As for the food, lunch was excellent. We already have reserved a table for tomorrow night. If you are looking for fancy lamp pops why would be here anyway...this is a pub and it is England's version of home cooking.

Food was good and tasty with a French influence and perfect seasonal dishes. Explanations of dishes we were not familiar with were clear and confidently delivered by Ella and when I said I was undecided between three dishes she questioned my likes and how I preferred steaks cooked etc to then recommend me one of the dishes.

4242,The Queens Head,440685918,November 2016,Decided to put down this review based on few visits over the last few months. Firstly I think the quality of service has improved considerably over these months as we were not impressed on the first visit. There is great deal of attention from both the manager and waiters while secondly the communication is easy and response is very good. I specifically want to mention few dishes that I believe must deserve attention. First of all it's chateaubriand steak for two - absolutely worth waiting a bit. Secondly mussels and salmon are both very good quality as seafood and well prepared to underline the quality. Thirdly beetroot (three types) with goat cheese is a very good starter. Wine list is probably not the longest one but very well balance for the quality and price. What is important I think that the quality is consistent now.,5.0

Washed down with a tasty NZ sauvignon blanc. Although there were other visitors to the city, there were also a lot of locals.... a good sign.

The problem was that my wife is coeliac and and my daughter allergic to dairy and we explained and asked if they have options for them.

4277,Gola Restaurant,183974813,November 2013,"Having a beautiful holiday in Tuscany this summer I am always desperate to replicate some of the ambience and food we ate there. We went to Gola this evening for a casual supper as it is somewhere we have always liked the look of. Unfortunately I have to admit that I found our meal not to be worth the price tag. My boyfriend's veal and beef pasta was wrapped in baking parchment which made it a rather laborious task to eat, although the flavour was good it seemed a little fussy in presentation. Moving on to my white truffle pasta-The buttered pasta on its own was £8 and then £8 per gram for the truffle shavings. I asked the waiter for a gram as that is what I wanted to pay. After the meal they charged us an extra £4 for the extra half a gram he had put on. I found it off-putting as I would rather have know what I was paying for upfront and been given the amount I asked for. I also thought the pasta dish was not worth its hefty £20 price tag considering the portion size. The owner is charming and was very responsive when I raised this bugbear at the end of the meal. I just felt that £65 for a bottle of wine and two pasta dishes was pretty hefty considering the quality of the meal. Overall I'm afraid i don't think we would return to Gola. Luna Nuova down the road does a similar pasta dish, albeit with black truffle, which seems to have a richer flavour with a more generous portion of pasta. I don't pretend to be a truffle aficionado and perhaps others may disagree but I felt rather underwhelmed by our experience this evening.",3.0
4278,Gola Restaurant,192793304,January 2014,"This is a well located trattoria in a part of London where there is lots of choice. The reviews on Tripadvisor attracted me but perhaps they have inappropriately raised my expectations. Objectively they are not in my opinion a true reflection of this restaurant. Gola is neither bad nor good but simply mediocre. Whilst overall one cannot fault the effort and affability of the staff the culinary experience is patchy and mainly too expensive, especially for the environment - if I am going to pay Michelin star prices I would expect a table cloth etc. Some dishes (eg cicory with beans) are pretty authentic (my qualifications?: I have eaten in Puglia almost as often as Paul McCartney has sung Hey Jude) and good but other dishes are just OK (linguine with (frozen) seafood at £22) and others are dreadful (profiteroles). This is a reasonable trattoria but the price of the food and the difficult to justify wine mark up (500%?) are sufficient deterrent for a return. I regularly pay less at The River Cafe and Riva in Barnes - 2 superior culinary experiences by a country mile - and less than this distance as the crow flies.",3.0

4280,Gola Restaurant,192738470,January 2014,"In London Italian restaurants tend to occupy vast swathes of middle ground in terms of quality and value for money, very few excelling or terrible.

Puglia is an area famed for simple vegetarian and sea food with liberal lashings of olives, olive oil and Pane di Altamura, we are from Puglia and thought this would be a low risk venture. On the Fulham Rd, we were not expecting to walk into a cliché Italian restaurant of the seventies, a veritable Aladdin's cave overly adorned by fairy lights, does Gola wish to give the impression that Christmas come late in Puglia or do they intend to leave the lights up till next year ? The walls were covered with the labelled elements of the wooden boxes commonly used for expensive famous wines a bit naff and certainly countered by the less impressive plastic table tops, plasticated menus, and a waiter going about his business listening to his ipod via plugged in ear buds. To cap this stylistically jarring scene there was freely available hairgel in the gents which produced flash backs to John Travolta's Saturday Night Fever.

The highlights were the Sunday roast and the pork and leek sausages that two of us had for our entrees. The cheesecake was very different than American cheesecake.

Better not to offer scallops at all on the menu than to produce a stingy-looking plate as a starter with two tiny specimens of inferior quality, cut thinly enough to stretch across a plate in single file. Nor was there nearly enough dressing as accompaniment. My pork terrine was delicious, but there was not very much of it, and the extra toast failed to mask the absence of real substance to the dish. The liver and bacon by contrast was delicious, a very generous plate, well cooked. All in all, pretty run of the mill pub food at prices that suggest something rather better.",3.0

The bar staffs laissez faire attitude to liberal drinks measurements vindicated our decision to spend our Saturday evening here. We slotted in nicely at the bar, close to the kitchen serving hatch, where we spent our time admiring both the food and the alluring waitress.

The service is excellent and always accommodating, and the atmosphere is relaxed.

The food was delicious, and the roasts were large - we were completely stuffed after finishing! This pub is in a quiet residential area, but well worth making the effort to get to.

Located on a quiet, unassuming street it seems so ordinary and is fantastic. The decor is classic old English pub but not at all kitsch or contrived, it feels very honest. There's lots of space and the music is cool. The staff are AMAZING. Some of the best service I have ever had, they are very chatty and helpful. The food is fantastic, I'd say proper classic pub food but done very well - I particularly recommend the calves liver though the top-hat pies looked incredible. The wine menu is extensive and there are even gluten free desserts, and yet the place just isn't pretentious at all. I will be back and hope more enjoy it soon.",5.0

Food tastes great, especially their in-house beer for me, very smooth on the throat when you down it. Food portions are also quite huge, so I advise you to order a bit first, and if not enough, then order again.

The bartender and waitress were very friendly, they took our order while we were having a drink at the bar so by the time we were seated appetizers came right away. We had scallops and goat cheese appetizer both were excellent. For dinner my husband had to sea bass and I had the leg of lamb. The lamb is a very generous portion enough for two.

4375,The Queens Head,386836393,May 2016,"Strange one this place. I think its the bar, which is divided by a huge pillar and means that getting served on the main seating site depends if the bar staff, who often congregate doen the other end esp. when its quieter, can be bothered to come and look. That in turn means that congregating at the bar corner is the norm and as a result the place has a rather sedate feel to the ""left"" side. The choice of beer is fairly bog standard, and the wine is priced as per the in house restaurant. The food and service in the latter is excellent but expensive for a pub restaurant, although this place has always had aspirations of grandeur (remember ""L'auberge""?). So its good food and drink, but could do with a cheaper bar menu and a better range of craft beers to reflect the up market aspirations and intent.",4.0

We asked about the different kinds of beer and were given a good explanation. The same goes for the delicious gin later on. I ordered a roast lamb shoulder. Never have I had such a perfect lamb dish, neither a piece of meat of such an enormous size nor of such tenderness and taste. The others had burgers, which were equally good.

We then made the mistake of all ordering the same main course of pork loin because the description on the menu sounded so delicious and the waitress had mentioned that a customer in the corner near us had just said it was outstanding ! That it was not. It was very ordinary and nothing exceptional at all. The best part of the whole evening, was the 2 bottles of Barbera red wine that we shared, which was smooth and really good. The atmosphere is lovely, and we were seated next to a roaring fire which was very cosy. The waitress was outstanding and VERY friendly and efficient.

For the service, I would give 3/5, it was no more or less than you would expect in most places - just pretty average. The ambiance and condition of the place was 1/5, the carpet and furniture were very worn out and the glasses used to serve drinks have seen better days; also the pub allows pets in - so on getting inside, I was first convinced there was some sort of dog show happening, some lady brought in all 3 dogs at once.

What has been a consistently great gastro pub for many years has recently changed management and it looks like they've thrown the baby out with the bath water. Easter Sunday lunch was the most average bland meal it's been my misfortune to experience, stewed vegetables, no presentational flair whatsoever. This place had once produced the best pork dish I've ever eaten. Clearly the new management and chefs have had a deleterious effect on what used to be our mainstay place to take family and friends.

It was delicious food, cooked to perfection. We didn't try the steaks as they are quite pricey, but we'd definitely go back for steak one day. The wine menu was fabulous - a great selection at several different price ranges. Our only issue was at the end. Unfortinately we ordered dessert, which then took 45-minutes to arrive. It was frustrating as it was 9.45pm when we ordered, and there were very few tables left. In fact, a final table were seated and got their main course while we waited for dessert - a baileys coffee, two waffles and a lemon tarte. It meant by the time we'd paid the bill we'd missed last orders in the pub, and we'd wanted to have a last drink in the beer garden before heading home. I'm sure this was dessert delay was a rarity.

When we had seated ourselves at the table one of the waitresses came out to advise us to move under the large umbrella as it could rain - we thought this was very sweet.

Portions were good (not too big), for the Sunday roast even very large. I had the Scallops and squid appetizer which was nice. The halibut was cooked to perfection, the accompanying potato and chorizo pie very nice just a bit too strong taste for the delicate fish. The sticky toffee pudding was delicious, could have done with a bit more sirup. But then they don't make it as good anywhere as the do in the Black horse in Turnham! Very good value for money.

4479,The Andover Arms,245518282,December 2014,"Visited a week before Christmas, tucked away hidden gem is a phrase others have used and it's pretty accurate. On arrival place was heaving and hot. The sort of cosy Christmas atmosphere we were hoping for. Had to wait about 20mins past our booking but staff were attentive and we got the drinks in. I had half shoulder of lamb... Fell off the bone and was a very big portion. My mate had the Turkey with the whole nine yards. It's big portions, tasty, well cooked, which is what we wanted. I've had similar from other pubs so don't get the idea this is haute cuisine that will open your eyes to a fourth dimension in dining. But the whole package, atmosphere, service and good food makes it a place to seek out if you're in the area. The cute Polish waitress didn't hurt either.",4.0

We had cream of brocoli and terrine and cranberry chutney appetizers. The bread was grilled and delicious. The fish was tender, the tartare sauce delicious and the pie and gravy were very tasty.

Firstly, the atmosphere was warm and cosy and very welcoming, the service was friendly and efficient, great recommendations on wine but the food was fantastic. I eat here a lot and know how good it is but when you are with colleagues and it's your recommendation, you are very aware of people's opinions! All of us were served promptly and the food was fresh,well presented and delicious. The portion size can defeat the best of us but my guests loved it. The pub was absolutely full and I know there were other large tables so to deliver food of that quality with no delays and with a smile? I'm impressed. Plus the kitchen looks and is tiny!!

I had the pie which was delicious and my son had a shoulder of lamb which looked like a whole side of lamb had been served. Compliment this with real fires and great beer and u have the perfect meal out for the average Brit who just likes food without all the dress code glamour and ritz that goes with dining at a Michelin star restaurant where you get tiny samples of food where presentation counts more than going home feeling full! Don't get me wrong I enjoy this sometimes, but if u want a wholesome meal the Andover arms is the place to go. If you want fine dining then book a fancy restaurant !",4.0

Service was outstanding, very attentive to every table and offered to taste the wine before serving, checking everything was ok and regular drink orders.

What it is is an incredibly welcoming pub and restaurant that suits local drinkers and visitors to the area alike, which serves good food in generous portions, and which has some of the most charming staff of any establishment in London. With that in mind, it merits its five stars and its praise. Starters are a particular joy, but in addition, hefty mains are cooked with assurance, are priced at deeply forgiving rates for London, and the wine list gives a lot of wiggle-room to diners at every price level.

We raved over celeriac salad, ham hock terrine, all three of us chose the lamb shoulder on one occasion and it was so good. As was the steak and frites on another. Even with dessert and a bottle of wine the total bill both times was so reasonable. It is well worth placing your order early enough to take advantage of the special menu.

Similarly with the cabbage, now do not get me wrong I much prefer my cabbage to kave some bite but this assumes that it has been cooked at all same thing with the cauliflower. I cannot fault the beef of the carrots but beef and carrots do not a Sunday roast make. The waitress, trying her best, offered to bring fresh roast potatoes whih when the eventually appeared, when the beef and carrots had long been consumed, turned out to be halved new potatoes slighty sauted and smelling of vegetable oil. The offered replacement cabbage did not appear at all. The manager offered the usual platitudes and offered us two bottles of house red 'plonk' as recompense along with the deduction of the price of two mains from the seven. Never again a thoroughly aweful experience an absolute disgrace.

4565,Gola Restaurant,152716756,February 2013,We went in a party of three. The first problem was having to sit at the back - but to be fair it was a Friday night and the restaurant was full. The food was average for Italian in London - no more than that and the price was high - nearly 100 pounds for a modest order with a bottle of the house red. My friend announced herself pleased however I was not so sure. I felt the owner pestered us a little to upgrade our order - a practice I deplore. If youre in the area a fair option - but I wouldnt go out of my way,3.0

We actually just ate in the Bar area, which has its own menu for bar snacks, but also allows you access to the full a la carte and also the set menus. I ordered the Gruyère Bagette with Chips which at £5.95 (and don't touch this price QH after reading this) is actually a very reasonable amount for a filling lunch! I have had this before at this place, but this time it was particularly loaded with cheese much to my satisfaction. Others in my party had the burger (excellent), the salmon baguette (excellent) and the steak baguette (funnily enough...excellent). The choice of ales is always something I love about this place and although I was not drinking, I did feel a pang of jealousy as the other males in the party washed down their meals with some Meantime Pale Ale! The service was excellent..I love restaurants where you get linen napkins! All in all a very well recommended place!

We had the Meze Board to share with a delicious bottle of Merlot, which got our gastric juices going, followed by the Half Shoulder of Lamb for my husband (almost too much for him but being a Lamb lover he was in his element and he was able to share a bit with my nephew who is a carnivore!), the Sirloin Steak for my nephew, the Chicken Breast for his wife, and the Sea Bass for me.

I ordered mussels and fillet steak and was very much looking forward to my meal. After about 15-20mins the starters appeared and instead of being presented with the mussels I was presented with scallops. I stated that i hadn't ordered scallops only to be told by the waitress that she was under no doubt that i had ordered scallops, she said she distinctly remembered what i'd said. At this point i started to doubt my sanity and felt like i was being accused of lying so to save further conflict i agreed to have the scallops. She said she was happy to take them back and change to mussels but that was not what i'd ordered. The scallops were nice, ate them and tried to forget the incident. When the mains arrived the fillet steak looked fantastic and tasted amazing but sadly the medium steak i'd ordered was not what i'd been given. After i'd started eating both our steaks were clearly medium rare at best with a pool of blood on the plate. I was tempted to send them back but quite honestly I wasn't in the mood for a battle so finished the meal. It was a shame because it was a really nice cut but clearly not cooked as requested.",3.0

You almost forget you just left the hustle and bustle of London and not a quiet country road after a brisk walk. The staff are the friendliest I had ever encountered. Charming, funny and very efficient. The food is of an excellent standard. We always have the lamb, everything else looks so good on other tables but the lamb is just so so so so so so good. We never finish and they wrap it up for us to enjoy the next day or two. It really is an incredible potion of lamb. Don't forget it is a pub so please except people milling around enjoying a drink or two. Enjoy!",5.0

They run other deals on other days of the week too. At between £15 -£18 a main getting 50% is well worth it. However I'd pay full price too as the food is so good. I had the duck breast with a lovely citrus sauce, dauphinois potatoes and carrots. My husband had beef bourginon which was slow cooked to perfection. The food has just the right amount of flavour and tenderness. A joy to eat. The wine is good too and I recommend the Syrah or the Viognier.",5.0

4654,The Andover Arms,237470550,October 2014,It’s about a 10 minute walk from the Hammersmith tube stop. The pub is very quaint and in residential area. We went for lunch on a Tuesday and it was pretty quiet. I'm sure it would have been different if we had been there on a weekend or evening. I started with their soup of the day which was cream of celery. I then had an appetizer of grilled scallops & calamari on top of mashed peas with balsamic. My husband had their fish & chips. We topped of lunch with 2 Guinness plus Fuller Fox Red. Everything was very enjoyable and tasty. I read that the Andover Arms was rated the best pub in London…it was very good but I’m not sure it qualifies as the best especially give the remote location. Lunch for 2 was £45.,4.0

4658,The Queens Head,389409909,June 2016,"Visted here with my partner after a long day of travelling down from Sunderland to Chertsey and it was just what we needed! The duck was beautifully cooked, for me personally though it could have been a bit pinker, but it was so soft! The only things I can pick at is that there was too much meat to veg ratio, I found I'd ran out of veg before meat and the bits of orange in the sauce were quite bitter and left an after taste. I only say this as the veg was beautifully cooked and I would have been happy with more, but we hadn't eaten all day. Lovely, friendly staff and a beautiful place/location. . Only a few minor faults, but not everything can be perfect. Lovely place.",4.0
4659,The Queens Head,391535525,July 2016,Visited for a relaxing aperitif after a long drive from Newcastle. Walk around Weybridge after booking into our hotel. Like the outside appearance of the pub and was impressed with the inside as well. Enjoyed a couple of pints of London Pride whilst Mrs C enjoyed a couple of cheeky chardonnay's. Not the cheapest pub I have ever been in but that was to become our experience wherever we went down here. Felt sorry for the one barman who seemed rushed off his feet until other staff came in. This led to delays in being served. It seemed to have a nice beer garden which we didn't sample.,4.0

4663,The Andover Arms,235950093,October 2014,"The first thing you notice on walking into the Andover Arms is that it is most definitely not a 'gastropub'. Unpretentious, cosy and authentic to the core, it's a local pub of the old school with stunning food. As locals drank at the bar blissfully oblivious of all the rave reviews the pub was getting amongst foodies, we sat down at a chunky wooden table and tucked in heartily. Every detail was delicious, and the scallop, squid an pea puree starter was sublime - perfectly cooked, textured and sparkling with nuanced flavour. Mains were equally cracking, the staff superbly warm and friendly and the desserts a crowning pleasure. Brilliant - quality with no affectation - this will be my local whenever I'm back in West London",5.0

Quickly decided we may as well eat and as it was just before 7pm, we were found a table for 2 very quickly but the restaurant soon filled up around us. Sergio looked after us & could not have been more helpful. We could not fault our evening at all. We had the Mackerel starter from the specials and I had the Moules Saffron Mouclade. Both totally amazing. We both had T Bone Steak, again completely divine with a side of wonderfully seasoned green beans. I had the rhubarb Brûlée and we were more than happy with everything we had, the advice we were given and the way we were looked after.

However, this time we felt it was very bland and didn't resemble what we thought we had ordered. They checked that everything was ok before we started eating!! I did mention that I thought Beef Stroganoff was usually creamy. My sauce was yellow? He offered to change it for something else. But I said I would try it. He didn't come back after I had tried it! There wasn't much content very mean on the meat, one slice of mushroom and it even had bacon in it!! Lots of runny sauce. Where was the sour cream? My husband had salmon. Not a lot of it - no seasoning just plain salmon! My friend had daughinoise potatoes. This was just potatoes sliced. No evidence of cream. As cream also seemed to be missing from my Beef Stroganoff had they forgotten to buy any?? The one thing that went down well was the Baked Alaska! Alas the boys shared that so I didn't have that pleasure. It was incredibly hot in our part of the restaurant. I asked if we could possibly open a window. Alas the people sitting next to us said no so we sat and perspired for the evening!!! Starters, mains, puddings and two bottles of wine set us back £200.00. Definitely not worth it so won't bother again.",2.0
4668,The Queens Head,273526711,May 2015,I ate here on Tuesday evening. I've had some good meals here in the past as well as some that were pretty average. This time was not good. My starter was forgotten about so only arrived after the rest of the group had finished their starters. The fillet steak which I ordered medium came very well done and so was very dry. A side order of beans was £3.90 and hadn't had all the stalk ends removed. Its a lovely pub for a drink. I'll stick to that in future.,2.0

4673,The Queens Head,273870340,May 2015,The smoked salmon starter was over £7 for 3 or 4 teaspoons of chopped smoked salmon and lots and lots of bread. Also the menu description did not mention the dill - it did mention capers and parsley - but not dill which my wife and I dislike. The fillet steak was well cooked but small and I was shocked to find a charge of £3.10 added for the small cup of chips - a small to medium potato - which wasn't charged for with the fish. The focus on size efficiency and money making turned what was an otherwise good experience into one more akin to having your watch stolen by a charming handshake...,3.0

The drinks and home made roasted nuts were good but the lamb shoulder was incredible. I could barely finish it as the portion was so big, like a man vs food challenge.

Not the place for a quiet romantic meal as a lively pub, but well worth a visit. I booked my hotel to be near this and will do so next time I am in London.",5.0
4718,The Queens Head,243323915,December 2014,"We were going to a party at the nearby Mercedes-Benz World and needed somewhere for lunch before checking into our hotel. We found The Queens Head on Tripadvisor and were delighted with the ambiance, the food, the service, everything. There is an extensive menu but we went for the mussels and frites, something we have not had for a long time. The mussels were rope-grown, large and firm, absolutely perfect, and the frites just as they should be, flavoursome crisp, thin french fries, great for dipping in some mayonnaise. We had a great bottle of Rioja and decent espresso coffee. On top of all that, they had a gluten and dairy free menu and decaff espresso, very impressive. One thing to note, there are not many car parking spaces, so if you have someone with mobility problems, you will have to drop them off and then find somewhere to park in the village - and it is quite parked up. However, if we are ever in the vicinity again, we will definitely be back.",5.0

The food on the whole was acceptable but the serving of (what looked like) frozen french fries with the steaks, was well below what was required. Prices are not cheap, so we all expected the quality of the food to be good and fresh.

I use it for both business and pleasure and can say without exception that every member of my party has always been highly impressed by the food. The service is great too and the place never forgets it's a pub as well and I always sit in the bar instead of the restaurant. My last visit - a business lunch with two others - was surely the height of service and style. All three lunches (including my delicious baguette) were excellent, the wines were first class and reasonable and the service, as ever, faultless. To top all that, when we couldn't get a cab to the station, the manager drove us in his own car! Don't expect that every time you visit the Queen's Head but be assured - you'll get the rest of it.

The food was very high quality and it was good value. The only thing I would say was that our table was right by the open plan kitchen and it was very hot.

It was delectable, but one small point, the pie contained carrots and peas, now this wasn't an issue for me but my husband was trying to decide between the pie and the burger and had he known the pie contained veg he would of picked the burger so maybe they should state this on the menu.

Tucked away in one of the side-streets near to Brackenbury Village, this place is a must visit and worthy of the reviews - the menu is changed on a daily basis and being a pescetarian, I always went for the fish or veggi dishes. Having visited there probably 10 times over 12 months, I never had a bad meal - the quality was always good and the beer selection also helped (its a Fullers pub with the mighty fine Honey Dew on tap). The pub has started to get a lot more busy in recent months (probably based on all the glowing reviews) so we often booked in advance. (also required for using a Tastecard too).

We had two baguettes, gruyere cheese one and goats cheese one and they came with a generous portion of fries and salad garnish. Good value and tasty. Kids meals were good value too and enjoyed!

4793,The Queens Head,221878512,August 2014,"We visited this pub for the first time recently for a mid week lunch and made the mistake of interpreting the menu in a generous way. Ordering a melted gruyere cheese and onion baguette conjured up a vision of a large (or even average) slice of cheese topped by slices of onion. Instead the filling was composed of grated, melted gruyere which had almost disappeared and a slight addition of finely chopped onion. Sadly the side salad was drowning in dressing and the best part of the dish was the French fries (definitely not chips which should be chunkier). And all for nearly £6. We would happily have forgone the white cloth napkins tied with a piece of string for paper ones if what was a basic cheese baguette had been more generous in its basic ingredients. Even the baguette was a challenge with a base so hard it was difficult to cut. Perhaps the chef was just having an off day but with less than a dozen customers when we were there, we're not sure.....",3.0

The bartender was extremely attentive and made is feel welcome, we ended up only waiting about 5-10 minutes for a table while we enjoyed a drink at the bar. The night we went there was a small band playing which really added to the atmosphere. Our waitress was extremely friendly and made us feel at home. My husband had the steak and I had the steak and venison pie, we shared the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. This was by far our favorite meal in London.

The only negative I can pick out is the 12.5% discretionary service charge that is added to the bill automatically. I like to be able to choose whether the service is deserving of a tip and how much.

I ordered the pork roast and to be totally honest this is by far the best pork that I've tasted in my life.

I dined upon the salmon baguette and it was divine. It arrived after five minutes and tasted fresh and the baguette was warmed - a nice touch. All in all, a very good visit.

We had not booked but the place was fairly quiet around 6.30pm on a Wednesday night in September. The staff were really nice. Wife had Thai beef salad to start, which having not been offered any meant that it was very good. I had the spicy crab cakes which were not very spicy, just a bit bland. Wife then had lamb chops for mains which were very good (I was given a sample) and I had a very nice Steak and Venison Pie with good pastry, not always the case when I eat out. If there is Steak Pie on any menu then that is my first choice, even though I have been disappointed so often. No such worries here, the only fault was that the mash was a bit lumpy and not to my liking. We couldn't manage any desserts as we were stuffed. It was around 8pm now and the place was almost full, testimony to it's reputation. Lovely atmosphere. great staff and very good food on the whole makes this an easy place to recommend.

The chicken must have been no more than the size of a pigeon - two mouthfuls and the breast had gone. The chips were all right but only a very small portion. The green salad comprised, I think, a lettuce that had been put through a shredding machine. My friends' main courses did not look much more appetising. For pudding I ordered a scoop of chocolate ice cream - it was less than the size of a golf ball.",1.0

The food is very good and on the one occasion that it wasn't - filet steak was over cooked, it was replaced without any fuss and was perfect the second time around.

One foot in the door and we were greeted with “can I help you?” we were shown to a table with a chalk board that had our name and time on it. We ordered and the food arrived soon after. At this point it’s only fair to say that we have eaten in several Michelin Star restaurants so we have a good idea of how good food should be, let me tell you, this was right up there with the best of them, presented well, full of flavour, correctly seasoned and all at a fantastic price, it’s hard to see how anyone can not give this place top marks.

Our menu (see picture) was absolutely loaded with great things I wanted to try.We picked a £25 bottle of Lanark Sauv' Blanc to share while trying to decide what we were going to eat - and it was spot on. We ended up having the meze board to share (excellent) and then I had the steak and venison pie that was absolutely delicious. Am thinking about it as I type and recalling the perfect pastry and huge, melt-in-the-mouth pieces of meat in it. Just YUMMY!! My friends had the 28 days aged sirloin steak, and were impressed too. I rarely struggle to put away three courses, but the portions were generous and all three of us were stuffed. We forced down a shared serving of ice cream and that left me close to popping. I'd had my eye on the sticky toffee pudding - meaning I will now have to go back to try that out next time - shame! ;-) Our meal for three cost £129.60 for the meze board, three big main courses, a shared dessert, plus a bottle of white and a bottle of red (incl. 12.5% service charge).

4881,The Queens Head,170712644,May 2013,"This was the venue for my birthday. Having been there in February when we had a great meal we set out with high hopes and expectations. The place was very crowded on a Friday and it got very very hot. The service was amateur, young students who could just about manage okay when things were quiet but when lots of people came in and the heat started to rise they drooped under the pressure. The starters were okay but tasteless, the mixed bean salad had a creamy dressing which was not advertised and the person having it hates cream. The mussels were served on a very hot plate with a hot lidded pot. No warning was given and my teenage son lifted up the lid and burnt his hand which did not improve his mood at all. But the hanging offences came with the mains. Two of our party including the burnt teenager had the mackerel and potato dish. Absolutely disgusting - the fish was dark and slimy and sitting in a about half a centimetre of oil with a few overcooked tomatoes and new potatoes. Husband had steak and kidney pie which was served burnt and he remarked he only found about one piece of meat in the gravy. The poor person with the bean salad had a burger - not on the menu but they keep a few burgers on standby for those who don't like the fancier food. The burger was asked for well done. What she got was two burnt discs of charcoal with a tiny bit of grey meat between them. The side order of green beans was very overcooked and saturated in oil or butter ?The rest of the mains were okay but again strangely bland and tasteless. By this time the whole atmosphere of the meal was tense - teenager was sitting complaining about the mackerel with his hand in a glass of ice - my mother was picking round the mackerel in a ""manly"" manner trying to look as if she was eating it but was not - I was trying not very successfully to enjoy myself on my birthday not easy when four out of the seven of us had had terrible meals - husband getting grumpier and hotter by the minute. Husband then drove the teenager home whilst the rest of us had puddings. The portions were nano-sized but tasted okay except the chocolate mousse was a chocolate sponge - bit weird. A couple of our party had post-prandials. Only four of the seven had alcoholic drinks the rest had soft drinks or water. AND THE BILL? when sadly I had to settle up on my own birthday was a whopping £225 for seven of us which comes out at £32 per head. Will I be going back to the Queens Head for a meal - NO. AT most it will be for a drink. I felt thoroughly let down by this our local brasserie A really really dreadful experience. I should have complained but frankly by the end I just wanted to go home and forget the whole terrible business.",1.0

4892,The Queens Head,157575288,April 2013,"First visit to this place for about 15 years and very pleasantly surprised! What I instantly liked about the Queen's Head was that it was both a pub and a restaurant, and it seemed to have managed to still retain both identities, which for me is a rarity. I had arranged to meet two clients for lunch, and was pleased with the choice of venue as it had a very professional air about it. Arrived at about 1pm to be greeted by a friendly barman, and an equally good pint of London Pride. When we retired to eat in the restaurant, the service was equally as good. I ordered the mussels (Thai style) followed by a sirloin steak and both were excellent. The mashed potato was divine, but probably not great for my cholesterol level! For once, the steak was cooked exactly as I asked it to be, rare side of medium rare, and it was a very good piece of meat. If I was to have one very slight moan about the place, it was that the choice of decent red wines was very limited. All in all, would highly recommend, and will be back.",5.0

As soon as we walked in the door we felt welcomed and appreciated by all the staff. The service is over the top, not too pushy, just perfect. The home cooked food both nights couldn't have been more enjoyable. The first night my husband had the Guiness Pie and I had the roasted chicken breast with avocadoes and vegetables. I'm gluten, starch and sugar free and they readily accomodated my special diet with ease. The second night was ""roast night."" My husband had the beef with mashed potatoes, vegetables and a popover. He loved it. It was so good, he'd wished there had been more meat on the plate. I had the roasted leg of lamb with and couldn't eat the entire portion which is a rarity for me. It was moist, falling off the bone and the best lamb I've ever had. What a place! We suggest a reservation, which can be made online at their site. Also, make sure to check online for directions and print a copy if possible.

On arrival we were able to be seated earlier and the service was attentive if not a little strained the staff seemed to be under a lot of pressure and we did feel we were a bit of an incumberance to the lady who seated us and one got the feeling that locals and revisiters were much more welcomed. However having said that we had a really upbeat waiter called Felix. The food was ok but portions small, my daughters goats cheese was undercoked and the green beans were undercooked and inedible. We did not complain about this as we felt we would be seen as just wanting to cause trouble and again the lady in charge of the restaurant seemed to be struggling. Unfortunately our evening became very tense when the vacated table next to us became occupied with local young people who were not eating and one of whom was only drinking the tap water left on the table. We aired our concerns to the lady in charge quietly and out of sight of the young people who by this time were using the salt on the table to demonstrate the differences between different grades of illegal drugs. The lady explained to my daughter that had we not already had our main courses we could have been moved to another area as she could not move the drinkers. She said she would help with our drinks which is not what we were after (we had two filter coffees deducted from our bill and I was presented with a glass of sparkling wine which given the late time of the evening and the fact I was drinking red wine went to waste) She then tried to get us to move tables again but we insisted on staying were we were. The table of drinkers had increased to 6 by now and were nearly sitting on top of us and the language from one of the group did raise my husbands hackles. We did ovehear a conversation at the bar that we were a problem table who had come into eat late! there was a table of around 8 people who came in much later than us. I think if this pub wants to say it has a restaurant then drinkers should not be able to come and sit at tables until those paying to be there have finished their food etc otherwise we would have stayed at the bar and ordered our food to eat there. As it was we did not have desserts and we were pretty much ignored by staff, we fetched our last drinks from the bar paid our bill ( £160 for 4 people so not a small bill) and left.

Trying to cut through the beef was like trying to cut through a flip flop and the potatoes withstood a lot of pressure from the knife before breaking up everywhere but the fork.

IMHO, it is not for typical tourists who comes far from Shepherd's Bush. We had to travel half an hour through tube from central london to the place, all the stations are equally far from the pub. Then we walked to find the the pub tucked inside a neighborhood. there was rarely any human on the way to the place, and suddenly a person jumped to sell theft items to us! It was a bit dark around, so I was scared that anyone can hijack us. After walking for 12-15 minutes till the pub, we were more than happy to discover the warm lights of the pub. Undoubtedly the best thing about the place was the service, we were welcomed like regular guests. We ordered 2 dishes with fish, taste was 50% good & 50% bad. But honestly speaking, in both the cases it was not value for money. The ambiance was very nice, i could be a happy customer if I was from the neighborhood & could have stayed back till late night.

Everything was well cooked and served by friendly staff. We mainly stuck to beer (it was a very hot day!) and the selection on offer was good and well kept. This is the second time recently that I have travelled from my home in South East London to the western side of the city for lunch and perhaps the good life on offer here goes some way to explaining the crazy prices of the rather ordinary real estate on this side of town: the Andover Arms is situated in the trendy 'Brackenbury Village' area of Hammersmith.

We took the underground out to Ravenscourt Station and then about a 5-8 minute walk from there through neighborhood streets to find this gem of a pub. It is definitely worth the effort to get to. We did not have a reservation and while the pub is fairly small, the staff greeted us when we came in and said they'd get a table ready for us. We were seated quickly and given menus to review. The choice was difficult as everything on the menu sounded good. I understand the menu there can change daily as they definitely do 'fresh' food. I tried the traditional fish and chips and my husband tried their Leg of Lamb. The fish and chips were excellent and the fish was a piece of fish the size of the platter (huge). It was served with chips (fries) and mushy peas which you could tell were very fresh. My husband leg of lamb was massive. I tasted it as well and we both raved about it. It could not have been better! We had their sticky pudding with toffee sauce which was also very good. All of the wait staff that passed by were incredibly friendly and did an outstanding job asking if we were doing ok, needed anything, etc. To give an idea of price, an order of fish/chips, leg of lamb meal, 1 beer and 1 glass of wine came to 54.90 British Pounds. It was one of the best meals we had in London and by far the most outstanding service we had on our entire trip.",5.0

The starting crab fish with a bit of pepper was nice and super delicious and at the right amount to prepare you for the splendorous main course. One of the BEST grey mullet fish ever. The seafood risotto was also speechless... I'd pay double for those easily. Great atmosphere and super friendly service that really deserves one of my very hard to get 5 stars.

The portion sizes are really fantastic so it's great value (especially with a tastecard). The service used to be a bit lacking but they have recently hired new waitresses who are much more efficient and very friendly. Our waitress noticed that I had polished off all of the gravy on my plate and asked me if I wanted some more, which I really appreciated. The atmosphere is great too - always really busy so I'd recommend booking in advance! My only would criticism would be that the desserts don't always live up to the standard of the mains - the brownie and sticky toffee pudding aren't as rich or as goey as I would like.

Beef that just melted in your mouth ....cor!!! I can still see it now. The cost of drinks are a bit high but it is Weybridge after all!! The house white is the best and the restaurant is nearly always packed. Parking is an issue as sometimes the odd person parks in the disabled bay and just goes in for a pint ( no disabled badge on show) I was told he is a regular!! People park cars in the very few bays at the front and go shopping and mess things up for the customers! It just needs policing . Anyway, the team behind the bar and restaurant are well mannered and polite. The bar food is great and all in all a great place to eat, drink and be merry.",4.0

It was well worth zig-zagging the back streets of hammersmith! starter of poached egg on black puddin with asparagus & hollandaise sauce - yummy, sandy had fillet of mahi mahi (probably spelt wrong, sorry) a delicate flavoured fish with sweet potatoes, i had chicken stuffed with cheese wrapped in crispy ham & asparagus cream sauce. my description doesnt do justice to this excellent meal. thank you to vikki & the lovely girl bartender (sorry didnt get her name) for a lovely afternoon. cannot recommend this lovely place high enough.",5.0

The pub was really busy with diners and locals but we still received our food in good time and all was perfect. My scallops starter was fab and my chicken dish very tasty. The pies looked amazing ( def having that when we return) and the wine well priced and tasty. we all had starters and a main course, several bottles of wine and also some beers, followed by coffee liqueurs and a shred cheese board - the bill was 350 ish which for 8 of us seemed very reasonable. It was a mixed group of ages, 19 the youngest oldest 76 and we all said that we would happily return. I shall be going for a sunday lunch - location lovely, excellent food at great prices.",5.0

Something many places just don't get right. The menu had something for everyone, red meat options (great steak), burgers, chicken, fish (sole I think) and a couple of vegetarian options. About 10 mains in all I think. We missed starters as such and went for a Mezze option which was brilliant and would now order as standard.

We were visiting London (staying in Kensington) from the US and made the trek to Southhall. We were hoping that the experience at Madhus was worth the time and effort to get to Southhall. It absolutely was. The servers were very professional and the manager was a complete gentleman who made us feel at home. My parents, originally from Punjab, loved every minute of our dining experience. We enjoyed appetizers, drinks, full meal and desserts. The food was fresh and authentic. My son has nut allergies and they were very responsive to our concerns for no exposure to nuts. At the end of our evening we were happily surprised to find the bill was so reasonable. We may have made the trek from Kensington again had we had more time. The best meal we had during our week in London was at Madhus. Thank you!",5.0

5314,The Andover Arms,308666919,September 2015,"This friendly pub is located in a quiet Hammersmith neighborhood, far off the tourist trail and about a 15-minute walk from Ravenscourt Park station. We nevertheless journeyed there because of its excellent Tripadvisor ratings. They are justified; the shortcomings I will note are mainly mine. The pub's interior is pleasant, with rustic tables and music that is not too annoying. The noise level (on an early Wednesday evening) was low. Our waitress, while seeming a bit frazzled, was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. When I said I don't know much about ales, she let me taste two from tap. Because they tasted horrible to me, I ordered a third, bottled one that was just as disappointing. I really wanted to drink an Imperial Stout, but the waitress did not know what I was talking about. Another waitress let me know that people would not order such strong beer. What can I say? I much prefer strong beers to weak ones, but I seem to be a minority (also at home in the USA). Anyway, the beer debacle aside, our food was really very good if one discounts the soggy chips and mushy peas, both of which seem to be made to please English palates. My wife's fish was fresh and crispy, and my vegetarian dish was inventive and quite delicious. I ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert and received what I thought were brownies. I ate them anyway and enjoyed them greatly. Later the waitress insisted that I had eaten sticky toffee pudding, and to demonstrate it she brought me a brownie to try! That was really sweet of her (though too sweet for me to continue eating). She was right, of course: I just did not know that a sticky toffee pudding is not a pudding but a kind of sponge cake! British terms are sometimes misleading to Americans. So, as I said, the shortcomings were all mine, and the blameless pub deserves five stars.",5.0

The Mezze starter plate for 2 was huge, barely leaving room for what followed :) Then the lamb was gorgeous (but so huge, again) and the aged sirloin steak perfect tender.

The food was delicious and both our children (7 and 10) loved the lamb starter! The staff is friendly and helpful and is always willing to advise you on any choice of food or drinks. As always the restaurant was full and there is not a lot of space between the tables. Still you do not feel like your in your neighbours lap and you can enjoy a lovely mail. And last but not least the food is reasonably priced too.

Our experience was a bit more mixed. Firstly the positives. It is obviously a family restaurant and the service was friendly and efficient. The food was good for the main part (the only real negative was a very oversalted truffle sauce that came with the ravioli) but not in any way memorable. I don't know if the menu changes from lunchtime to evening but unless you are planning a ""special"" lunch, it is expensive. We had a starter, main course (and by no means the most expensive ones on the menu!) and a small carafe of house wine, no desserts or coffee, and the bill came to £113.

We were treated as family as soon as we arrived. Aaron the owner is great. He told me he would make me cry from happiness, and I did, but I did not cry from happiness I cried from the taste of the food. It was AMAZING!!! Beyond words. He made us several appetizers and then several courses of different pastas I couldn't even attempt anything after that. He did then bring us a delicious dessert. I loved everything about this restaurant, I loved it so much that when my daughter and her friends arrived in London I took them there for dinner. My daughters friend also cried upon trying their ravioli dish. Another of her friends was sad to see the meal end. They all said it was the best meal they had ever eaten.

5356,Madhu's,155989191,March 2013,My experience of Madhu's was disappointing to say the least given I had high expectations from some of the comments on this site. The service was poor as all the waiters were focussing their attention on a large group of diners and when we did get service the waiter was unhelpful at explaining the menu and was generally rude. The food was no better; I ordered a masala fish curry which was far too salty and my friend ordered a chicken curry which lacked flavour. The only positive comment I have is that the portions were good but for the price we paid I would expect higher quality service and food.,2.0
5357,Madhu's,157294302,January 2013,This is rated the best in the area and I can believe it. I have eaten in here numerous amounts of time. They do a lamb rib starter which is mouth watering. There are 2 floors and we always like to sit upstairs if possible. I would recommend making a reservation here as it really does fill up. Service is sometimes hit or miss though but that is me being picky. I have never had a bad meal here. You pay for the experience though but worth it.,5.0
5358,Madhu's,157360060,April 2013,"Went to this restaurant after a very long and tiring day. Expectations were very high as the brand itself are very well known caterers...came with my family which included 2 children, aged 3 and 5. It took at least 20 mins for the menu to come to us, popadums were served without even us requesting with no dips. Drinks came to the table one by one with out them being served on a tray, the kids had requested water however none was served and I had to ask twice, and when we finally got water the staff were serving it in the large wine glasses that had been sat on the table...how on earth can a 3 year old grip a large wine glass...the staff seemed very lazy. The food itself was served on side/starter plates....was very surprised how this Indian restaurant was serving, I had taken a look around and saw others had been given dinner plates but for some reason we got starter plates. The starter plates were given to us after the food came out and the roti/naan they had forgotten to serve which also came out after a further 20 mins...and when the roti came out they gave us less then what we had ordered! by the time the roti/ naan came the food had gone cold. A series of disasters and bad service. The restaurant itself was not so busy and staff were free...just seemed very lazy not professional...a well known brand which I can see going downhill due to its staff and quality of food being below average...have eaten at many top restaurants...however this one a big disappointment.",1.0

The waiter/supervisor looked baffled and checked his little book and said I'm sorry sir, we have no booking under your name. To cut a long story short, had I not kicked up a fuss and lost my temper, we'd have found ourselves looking for another restaurant to have my evening birthday meal. In the end I refused to speak to him and demanded the manager to show his face and sort out this basic error from one of the most renown Indian restaurants.

5372,Gola Restaurant,318480528,September 2015,"The food here is decent bistro-type Italian, as is the decor and general ambiance. There were four of us and choices included two pasta (three if you count the raviolo starter ), one fish starter (calamari) and one fish main. It was all good: no more than that. However it was the most overpriced restaurant we visited. We ate in some wonderful places that were a little more expensive (Thank you Gymkhana) and others that were cheaper but much more interesting (take a bow, Mahdi). Wine too was overpriced. I realise that this is West London where money is plentiful right now and presumably there are people happy to pay such prices for average food. I was struck by a reply to a comment such as mine on prices, here on TripAdvisor from the manager of Gola, more or less saying that if you can't afford it don't go. Surely she misses the point; whether people can afford it or not (we could) is irrelevant to whether the food represents good value. We could afford the prices but this didn't make Gola good value: it wasn't. In fact it was the only meal in London that we felt was very poor return for the price.",3.0

The Queen's Head doesn't serve 'pub grub' it serves quality restaurant food in a pub.

I can tell you that this little pub would give any top restaurants in central London, a run for their money! I went in early November to see Dynamo and ended up staying in Hammersmith. The hotel is easier to find on foot than by car, although a cab could probably find it easily. A few twists and turns from Hammersmith tube station and your there! The Andover Arms has the feel of a traditional cosy and homely pub..BUT.. there is a twist to this place! Put it this way..I booked a table for two and the moment I came in, I was greeted by my first name, by the lovely manager herself '' Olska''! The welcome you get even before you order is amazing. Gemma and Olga are wonderful girls who have great knowledge of the menu's and can give recommendations if needed! Myself and my friend ordered the steak, which was cooked perfectly! We then had the sticky toffee pudding with homemade ice cream, which was to die for!! My friend and I enjoyed the meal so much, we booked to come back the next day for a Sunday roast! We were not disappointed the second time round! I had the beef roast, cooked medium well, and my friend had the the shoulder of lamb. The size of the lamb was so huge, i'v never seen anything like it! Both dinners's were cooked to perfection, including the vegeatables, which were all aldente which is how I like it! Thumbs up to Rupert the chef and cooking team! The cooking is SUPERB here!! And it will take some beating in my opinion from any other restaurants I have already eaten in! The customer service is just as suberb, and prices are also very reasonable....there's always a warm welcome and service with a smile from the Andover team!

5413,The Queens Head,573614439,April 2018,For the price the food is of poor quality but that is Weybridge for you. Inflated prices suggesting you will get something special and then the disappointment. Service is OK with service added on the bill. Paid as the waiter did try but could not explain what was in the fish soup. It has fish in it! That is good to know!! I dine out alot and this gets a Terrible and deserves it. Never again much better food and value elsewhere in town.,1.0
5414,Gola Restaurant,329824655,November 2015,"I have been to Gola several times. Initially I went for curiosity as the food is specialised in Apulia cuisine which is so rare to find in the original version outside Italy. I am speechless as the quality of food is so authentic fresh and good that I can only compare to my mamma home food. If you want to eat the original Italian food without compromise of strange floating creams to please the locals, this is the best place in London. I now go to GOLA every time I can and every time I try new recipes and specials and I have checked personally talking in Apulia dialect and I can tell you that the owner and cooks are really from Puglia. I can't wait to be back at Gola and enjoy with the amazing atmosphere and the excellent genuine Italian food and wines. They are absolutely right: you are what you eat!

5429,The Queens Head,577590200,May 2018,"Having read some of the negative reviews, I was wondering if my group of 8 had dinner in the same place last night? As a group, we regularly eat at local restaurants and last night was our first visit to the Queen's Head. This is the best restaurant that we have visited to date. Our experience was absolutely amazing and is summed up in the word 'passion.' Even though the restaurant was busy, the staff welcome you like old friends and nothing is too much trouble. You are not ignored (as in some restaurants) and the service is totally professional, friendly, efficient and the product knowledge shown by the staff is first class. They are clearly passionate about ensuring that their customers have an experience to savour. One look at the very extensive menu shows just how much effort the chefs must put in, to offer such a superb range of very tasty, not over-priced and on occasions, very different culinary offerings. Where else can you try the excellent starter of Vietnamese Summer Rolls? No, they are not the standard Prawn Cocktail, nor should they be. Variety is the spice of life. The chefs are clearly passionate about the food they produce. A special mention should also go to our waitress, Ella. She ensured that our visit was everything that we would have hoped for and then some aswell. Also congratulations and many thanks to Harriet and all of her team, for an excellent evening. Yes, (as General McArthur once said) 'we will return!'",5.0

But just around the corner of Bradmore park road we where surprised to find this local pub with lots of guests drinking and dining. the staff is really pleasant and helpful. The ambiance is down to earth and very welcoming. The food..... we shared the starter because of the late lunch we had at Borough market.

Prices are slightly above what is perceived as average but I didn't mind in this case and we will be back (even more when moving to Fulham).",5.0

Nestled in Brackenbury (between Hammersmith and Shepherds Bush) the location is just enough out of the way to make passing trade minimal. The result is a mixed clientele : locals enjoying a relaxed relationship with the management and visitors excited to have sniffed out a hidden away gem. The menu is pub food - unadventurous but well put together solid staples like steak pie and beer battered fish and chips. I would have tried the Lemon Sole if it hadn't run out but the Mahi Mahi stood in well. A good cheese board included a tasty sheep's cheese and a lively Stinking Bishop. I wouldn't say cross London to try the Andover but if you live anywhere near W6/W12 then you'll get a friendly welcome and a comfortable and enjoyable evening.",4.0

I had the burger which was ok but not amazing given the price - I’d ordered it well done as am 9 months pregnant but it was pink in the middle. The thing that attracted me to the pub was the healthy children’s menu, however when my child’s portion of ‘steamed vegetables’ arrived they were just green beans covered in olive oil and sea salt! Not exactly the healthy option that I’d been hoping for for a a 2 year old! Having said that, he absolutely loved the mac cheese. Parking outside for about 5 cars and that’s it.

Also they were extremely keen to push their recommendation despite us politely declining many times.The food was mediocre at best and definitely not worth the money.For a table of three we paid £110 for one round of drinks,starters and main courses which even though not extortionate,was not worthy of the food and service provided.Also they added a £10 tip to the table of three people which for a restaurant in Southall I felt was not justified.

I love the chicken and chorizo pie, they do an excellent roast, good fish dishes and the desserts are always very tasty, whereas a lot of pubs seem to fall down when it comes to puds. Not all dishes are huge. Recently I had an avocado and salsa salad starter with scallops, quite a small dish which was perfect before a big meal and really fresh & tasty.

A variety of starters came back with cured meats, mozzarella, polenta chips, aubergine and slices of bread. For our mains we told the staff what we liked and they picked dishes for us - milanese, a whole sea bass, some pasta... more fantastic food. And at the end they picked a few desserts for us to try.

We came for Sunday lunch a couple of weeks ago. I noticed that the prices had increased since last time - understandable as it's been a while, but the roast beef - priced at £13.95 2 months ago was now £16.50! (though I've noticed it still says £13.95 on the website). Quite a hike! So I decided to order something else! I liked the fish pie. The sauce was very tasty though not very thick. My husband's meat pie was perfectly ok but not as flavoursome as other pies we've had there. We both ordered a cheesecake - which used to be a real favourite for us and were really disappointed. It was rather heavy - nothing like as light and tasty as before and it no longer came with ice cream, so we ordered some as a side ! The compote it came with however was lovely.

5654,The Andover Arms,390637312,July 2016,"We were going to a Santana concert in the evening and decided to book a late lunch (3pm) somewhere nearby the Apollo. We had parked in Barnes and walked the long way around the river as it was such a nice day. We arrived a little early and had a drink first. The place is a quaint old pub in some residential streets about half a mile from the centre of Hammersmith. There are a mix of tables, we had a small one in a corner where we sat side on to each other. If you go here, you had better be hungry or don't order all the courses. The portions are massive. As we had plenty of time, we decided to have starters, I wouldn't do that next time, although my Wife preferred her starter to her main meal. For me it was the other way around, I had the small meat board as a starter, way too much and I didn't like the choices of meats and decided to bail out, leaving some. As it was a Sunday the roasts were on the menu and I fancied the lamb. It was lovely, although it already had the mint on it and and would have rather had it without. The meat fell off the bone. The potatoes were lovely and the Yorkshire pudding good, but a little dry, which was OK as there was plenty of gravy. I didn't finish this either, but I would have done if I hadn't had a starter. We had some more wine with the meal and decided to try a dessert & coffee, I was so full I had the affogato. The staff were very good, the guy who made my Wife a Pimms when we arrived really took his time preparing all the fruit. The bill was a little higher than I expected, but that is partly because I shouldn't have had the starter and also that the lamb is a bit steep at £20. It was a very pleasant lunch and it set us up for the rest of the day, in fact I didn't eat again until gone midday the next day.",4.0

Gave the staff the opportunity to clear the tables but after half an hour asked a bar man who was busy chatting to a colleague about a night out if he could clear the tables he asked me which table I was sitting at . I explained there were at least six tables which needing clearing. He replied yep mate !! He then went round picking up glasses but left the empty plates napkins and pieces of string and did not wipe any of the tables. Now people are arriving for evening service and moving the detritus themselves.

For dessert, I strongly recommend the gnocchi with Nutella and chantilly cream, and the cannolo (which is a destructured cannolo as you can see from the picture).

So not a great table, but the last straw was when something hot and wet flew into my hair (I was seated nearest the kitchen). I don't know if it was oil or water, but the grill is right by the table and there were meats cooking so it's entirely possible that it was hot fat.

My son and I both ordered the minute steaks from the specials menu (we asked for both to be medium) The restaurant was virtually empty, and it took at least 30 minutes for our “minute” steak to arrive following starter. The waitress asked who was having the well done steak and we said we ordered medium for both. She said “well, I have one well done steak, who’s having it?” , so rather than create a fuss I agreed to have it. We were starving at this stage. To say my steak was dry is an understatement, but I was hungry and tried to pick away to find the best bits. After a minute the intense burnt, bitter charcoal taste kicked in. I left a leathery piece of blackened steak on my plate and just focussed on the chips. My son worked his way through his and towards the end said he was struggling to swallow the meat! We had paid at the bar when we ordered, but before we left we decided to tell the manager of our bad experience. He eventually agreed to refund our main courses , but offered no apology for the poor cooking of the steaks. In fact he simply told us off for not having complained earlier (fair point, but didn’t want to wait for another 30 minutes). An apology would have been the right thing to do in this situation.

I was not keen to try here but the hotel concierge was very complimentary and it was close to the hotel. It is difficult to find especially when my satnav decided not to work. Do not worry if you have to turn into the Marriott as you can go round the car park and come out not on the main road and then just the follow the road to the top. The menu is large in the restaurant where we ate as it was much quieter than the pub part and was full service. We all had fish and it was as everyone says large portions but cooked beautifully. The people at the next table looked as though they had half a chicken! It was all finished. We decided to share a dessert for the table and thought my friends should try bread and butter pudding with custard as being a truly English dessert. It did not look as though it would be great but it truly was especially with the delicious custard.

5816,Turtle Bay - Walthamstow,723793872,November 2019,Me and my friend had some lunch in this place. We ordered burger and some sides (4 for £10). Portions was huge. Only bad thing was we waited about 45 minutes for 2 burgers and some sides and burger doesn’t come with chips so you need to order extra. But the food was delicious. After our order we asked why did take that long and she apologised for the wait and said because of the takeaway order kitchen was busy. Definitely recommend this place.,4.0

5874,Turtle Bay - Walthamstow,690224306,July 2019,"Quite disappointing experience in this place as I have been visit before and the service was great. We visited on Sunday evening with dinner with friends and even made a reservation. We came a bit earlier and we were welcomed at the door and had to wait for the table for few minutes but in the mean time we were sat at the bar so we ordered a round of drinks, while we were waiting we had told that our table was ready and we were seated at the table and cocktails were brought to the table which was great and seemed like the service is spot on as it usually were. We waited at the table about an hour since we were seated down and even despite the fact our friend being about 40 min late no one had even approached our table by that time. I approached the waiter and I believe the manager on duty and asked if we could order and the response was no sorry we are too busy at the moment from the waiter but after I mentioned that we did not receive service for the past hour the manager said he will come up and take the order which happened after few minutes. Luckily we still managed to get our food and have a meal with friends but felt like it was rushed as the restaurant was closing soon so did not have a chance to enjoy. After we finished our meal and obviously as it was Sunday the place was closed by that time we had even to wait for staff to notice us as we still did not get our bill and we had to ask for it. As I live in the area myself and this has been one of the top places to go out for dinner and drinks this time really disappointing me as there seemed to be a lack of customer service on the night. I work in hospitality myself and I can understand that sometimes you are understaffed and the waiting time can be longer but being ignored for almost whole time of the visit, asking to order and even asking to pay is really unaccountable. Not sure what happened on the night but did not even feel that it was busier that most of the days I visited previously. As far as I could observe staff was concentrating on other things rather then customers at that time and we were not the only people who were disappointing in the service. the only good points we had during this experience were that the food was amazing as it always were and service at the bar was spot on as we had to order our drinks there.",2.0

Then you order and pay for your drinks at the bar and as near as we could tell there was no wait staff which did not matter. We sat down and chatted with some locals sitting near us and they had nothing but good things to say about the place. Our food came pretty quickly and was very good. My wife had the veggie lasagna and I could not pass on fish and chips for my one night in the London area. We shared everything and it was all good. Lasagna was piping hot and very tasty.

5920,The Pheasant Restaurant & Pheasant Inn,611688495,August 2018,"Pheasant is the restaurant that you would probably enjoy the meal although you don’t know what to eat, you could just order any dishes and you could put the high expectation on them. No matter what are about: taste, portion or value. The place for ordering food is separating from bar. There are more than ten daily speciality dishes that you might be concerned. That’s a lot right? No worry, even though you order the same menu as last time you came, you could still enjoy with it, I guarantee. The waiters are so friendly and approachable. You could be sitting, chitchatting and relaxing with friends and also enjoying with food and drinks at the same time. But just be cautious about the portion which is very big. This restaurant could pack it for take away if you couldn’t finish but I recommend better not to. Some menu is certainly not for take away e.g. mussels, just for your own stomach to be safe. Apart from this, there are a massive range of time that you could choose to come and enjoy for the meal, just type Pheasant in google and it will show what time that the restaurant will be busy.

The ribs...no, I don’t know what that was...the coleslaw is definitely definitely not carribean style. You literally have to put your own sauce on it for flavour but then it’s not authentic no more.

So this time we decided to try out their bar food which serves more or less the same menu as the restaurant. The difference between the restaurant and bar is the way you order your drinks and food. In the restaurant the waiter takes your order for drinks & food and brings them to your table whereas in the bar you have to queue up separately for drinks and then queue up again at a separate counter for food. The food is then brought to your table. The quality of the food was good but the portion slightly smaller but enough to fill you up.

I sent a complaint email immediately to their inbox but no reply nearly a week later. Sad that there portions and customer service have dropped so drastically now that they have established their business in the area.",2.0
6247,Maggie Jones's,695886059,August 2019,"Lured by the very high reviews for this place, we wandered in for a last minute dinner on Monday evening. The restaurant staff were friendly but harried with very slow and spotty service. They were definitely trying their best but seemed either understaffed or simply had too many tables for what the kitchen and staff could handle. Water pitcher was not refilled, butter was placed on the table but they forgot to offer bread, long gaps between visits from the server. The meal took forever to come out, and we sat and waited for 30 minutes. The drink order took 15 minutes to arrive. Our leisurely dinner stretched 3 hours for a small party of two people. Apart from that, the food was pretty good but not mind blowing, and the barn decor and candlelight made the whole experience pretty fun.",3.0

But you don't notice the construction once inside the restaurant. Our seating for four was very close quarters in a small booth: Definitely part of the ersatz charm of the place (the walls are packed with all kinds of farm tools and country paraphernalia).

6332,Holy Smoke,576258597,April 2018,"We had been so looking forward to trying Holy Smoke after reading all the reviews and having recently moved to the area. It's hard to get in for an evening meal but we are around at lunch time and booked that - lunch is also extremely competitively priced at £12 for two courses and £15 for three. So we expected something simple...but tasty. My husband ordered the chicken livers which were ok but nothing special. My 25 year old daughter and I ordered the ""Slow roasted guinea-fowl wings, Bloody Mary sauce and blue cheese cream"". The wings were nicely roasted but poorly seasoned and it was hard to detect either the bloody or the blue in the fairly innocuous sauces. Where was the salt and pepper and some nice spicy flavouring - it had sounded like a lovely tasty dish! Following my husband had the ""Venison and pork meatballs, rich mushroom braise, celeriac mash, shredded carrot pickle"" which he thought was nice. We had the ""Warm nicoise salad with poached egg, french beans, new potatoes, cherry tomatoes black olives and anchovy"". What could go wrong we thought. But this too was a huge disappointment - lots of potato - thought they were good (but they made up two thirds of the salad), a few not particularly wonderful olives (that back of the mouth iron hit) a few nicely cooked beans and an overcooked (hard) poached egg and a few tomatoes lurking in the bottom of the bowl (we realised after we had left that they had forgotten the anchovies and that might have helped). The dressing was again fairly innocuous. Something mustardy would have enlivened such a dull salad - I hate to say it but I could have done a lot, lot better throwing this salad together for myself at home!",2.0

In fact it had only one shrimp, some muscles, clams and chewy small bits of calamari in it. I've had better in the states with shrimp, scallops, fish and varieties of bivalves that are delicious.

She then went on to suggest that we were too intoxicated to use our other groupon voucher, which was unfair and untrue. We left but she refused to give her name and maintained that she was correct in her decision. We went on to another local bar with no issue, leading me to believe it was either us she had taken a dislike to, or the fact that we were using a groupon.

Very nice welcome with a glass of smoked sherry on the tabke., Small menu but decent choice and wine list fine. Very friendly and very competent service. Starters Beets salad very good and I had excellent scallops. Main courses an excellent venison and I had the cod with a thai sauce. They were both very good. Followed by an excellent duck egg creme brulee. It was very pleasant and slightly quirky. Name 'Holy Smoke' because given a chance he will smoke anything not just the sherry.

From the welcome on arrival, when we had to wait whilst the greeter finished his paperwork, to the service, not only by our main waiter but everyone who served us, service was sloppy and not up to the usual standards. The atmosphere is always delightful, particularly if you have a booth which is tight for three let alone four people, but makes Maggie Jones's a characterful place for dinner. We ordered the Magnum of House Red Wine that is charged by the amount you consume - we finished the bottle so had to pay the very reasonable Magnum price for drinkable wine! We weren't offered water and had to request it. I always opt for the Onion Soup and it was amongst the best French Onion Soup I have had, so full marks on that score. My daughter went for the prawn salad that was a little too doused in dressing and my wife for another salad that she really enjoyed. My daughter always goes for the Maggie Jones's Chicken Pie and she was really pleased with her choice, I opted for the Pork Belly that came with mashed potatoes and a very nice gravy (the pork belly was fine but certainly not the best I have had) and my wife opted for another starter which was a savoury tart, she was really disappointed. I ordered a portion of cauliflower cheese between us (excellent) and a portion of triple cooked chips (inedible with a strange taste) - they went back.

From that moment, Andrea and his staff worked hard to ensure that last night, the party was one to remember. The restaurant and undercover outdoor area complete with heaters was perfectly sized. The staff were friendly and accommodating as always, and the food was out of this world, and commented on by everybody. By far the most authentic Italian food I have ever tasted, the passion for the ingredients was clear in every dish. Stunning food, superb staff, you will not be disappointed.

Hani even brought us a little freebie shot over. While having the cocktails I ordered half a dozen oysters. They were so fresh and just tasted of the sea. When we did sit down for our meal we had the mussels and pate starter. This was delicious. We had to order extra bread because you just couldn’t leave the sauce the mussels were in it was so nice. The steaks were cooked to perfection and the pudding was small but just enough after our large meal we just had. Our waiter Hermes was very attentive, polite and had a great sense of humour.

Upon asking if they have any pizzas with chicken on he replied we should leave the restaurant and find a Pizza Express or Pizza Hut, as it is not authentic to have chicken on a pizza. Our party found this humorous though the manager did not, and was seemingly rude to us for the rest of the evening. When our metre long pizza arrived, it was not anything special but just average. The restaurant was also very empty and not subsequent party arrived for the table to which we ""apparently"" were seated at. Also, after providing us with such a negative experience, the manager had the audacity to add 10% additional service charge, to which we asked for it to be removed as the service was poor. The response to this by the manager was truly unprofessional as he did not conceal his anger.

Pasta with fish (vongole or frutti di mare) is rich and tasty and the appetisers from caponata to bruschetta, not to forget sarde ai ferri or fried zucchini or warm olives in garlic and chilli are a real treat. Fish is very fresh and follows availability. Good choice of wines. I recommend for dessert pastier napoletana, a cake made with ricotta cheese and pine kernels which is made according to tradition. Bread is obviously home made thanks to the big wood oven for pizzas and focacce. A lovely court in the front gives a taste of al fresco.

They seem to have many neighborhood regulars who have reserved tables at 8 after, and all the ground floor tables will be spoken for after that. Outside is lovely in warm weather. We will look forward to returning for another meal on our next trip. A nice dining experience, nice neighborhood, great pizza!",5.0

Portion sizes were just right. My partner had the pigeon to start followed by the lamb shank and white chocolate mousse dessert, which were equally good. I was also thoroughly impressed by their whiskey and gin selection! Will definitely be going back.",5.0

Reluctantly they let my friend and I sit down and we ordered, from an extremely weak set of choices, a half metre pizza, only to be told we couldn't have that as our table was too small. They eventually arrived with two smaller pizzas which were burnt on the outside and stone cold in the centre and in edible. When I called the waiter over to ask him to remove the food, he argued with me that I didn't know how it should be cooked and I was wrong. He did eventually take both plates away. We then asked the manager for the bill and were charged a service charge for the two drinks we had. As we had no change we had to give a £10 note and the surly waiter eventually arrived with change of £4.35, all in coins of 10p and 50p denominations.",1.0

The main course of beef was delicious except only one slice and the roast potatoes were very under done. Desert was average.

But I squeezed in with an old friend on a Monday night. She'd booked. We were inside, near a raucous party of Japanese bankers. A Campari or two later and the world looked as sunny as the Tokyo stockmarket. We polished off jolly good antipasti. I'd questioned the waiter about the spaghetti alle vongole and had opted to gamble. It paid off. Quite the best I've eaten for years and a real surprise in west London. Good red wine by the glass. We chattered away unbothered by the service, which came and went just as you needed it. What a pleasure. Oh, and I left my vital red diary on the table, you know, the one with all the Tripadvisor passwords and so forth. They retrieved it and handed it back when I rushed in on my way back to Heathrow next day. Complimenti, signori.",5.0

We were given enough time (just) to finish our starter and main course before being asked, in no polite manner, to finish our drinks outside the second the bill was paid. The bottle of wine was recommended to us by the staff and we didn't even finish our drinks before being asked to move outside for the third time in 10 minutes. Such a shame the night ended the way it did, due to greediness of the manager.

The fish had a nice smell to be honest, maybe they are good, need to be tried!!! If uou would like to go for the pizza, it doesn't have nothing to do with the original one.

There are only 24 covers here which were all occupied on a Tuesday night, but you still get very focused individual attention from the charming and enthusiastic Patron. I even forgave him wearing shorts - what the hell! The menu is so creative, absurd, joyful, you just go with it.

The desserts are all delicious and make for some tough choices, I'd suggest trying a few and sharing them so you can try them all!

Boyfriend had the sea bass which was also excellent. we shared the chocolate brownie for desert, which disappeared in all of 30 seconds upon being placed on the table. Yes it's quite pricey, at £85 for 2 people, 1 starter, 2 mains, 1 desert and a bottle of wine, but the food was lush so in my view, totally worth it. would go back in a heartbeat, still dreaming of the guinea fowl !!",5.0

Fried Calamari very good and Parmiggiana excellent. Children had pasta with parmesan (the children's portion is rather small if the child is 7 years old or older). As for desserts, please make sure to order sfogliatelle napoletane and Aragosta (creamy chocolate inside), both are home made! Superb.

We sat on the front porch- very cozy seating, but great atmosphere. The menu had everything for every (Italian) palate (fish, meat, veggie, appetizers)- just not many desserts.

We normally avoid cheese in the hope of living longer, but there was something hypnotic about owner Cameron's knowing look which put us into a cheese trance and before we knew it we had polished off a plateful of three delicious and unusual varieties. Then as we snapped out of it we were offered a smoked whisky - something we'd never encountered - and, again under hypnosis, found ourselves sipping 10-year-old Ardbeg with smoke billowing from it. Cameron couldn't wait to show us his other smokey spirit concoctions (cigar rum, anyone?) and we imagined he had an illicit smoke lab out back like Heston Blumenthal in an episode of Breaking Bad.

It seems to be famed for it's Pizza's and I must admit they look fantastic, especially the metre long one which passed my table laden with mussels in their shells at one end and other deliciousness all the way along it. However, you are missing a real treat if you don't try their chargrilled offerings! I thought all day about the chargrilled squid I'd had on a previous visit and couldn't wait to give it another go. Starter of breadcrumbed mozzarella with a dollop of fresh pesto accompanied by a delicious diavolo sauce. The taste of great italian home cooking. And then the squid. Straight off the char grill, a huge plate of it cooked to absolute perfection needing nothing more than a rocket and tomato accompaniment. Really the best I have had anywhere. On a previous visit my partner had the grilled sea bass and hasn't stopped talking about it. Chargrilled, unadulterated deliciousness. Their fish really is of the highest quality, simply cooked. The staff are attentive and fun, they know what they're doing and do it with ease and style as only Italians know how. The place was buzzing at 7 so booking seems essential. This is now one of my favourites when visiting London. It has that real ""neighbourhood"" feel, somewhere you'd enjoy going to every week if you lived near by.

It is a small restaurant with only about 7 tables so it is quite an intimate affair with jazz playing in the background. The overall experience was brilliant. The staff were attentive and very knowledgeable about the food and particularly about what drinks should be paired with certain dishes. For starters my husband and I choose the mussels and the scallop dish. Both dishes were fantastic, but I think the scallops had the edge. The mussles were lovely and the sauce different from the norm, but it was so tasty. For the main meals we choose the venison burger and the pork dish. The pork was extremely succulent, but I have to say that the venison burger was a winner. I am not very keen on venison, but thought I would give it a go and it was wonderful. Very tast and the smokey chips that accompanied the burger were fantastic. If only I could try and replicate it I would be eating it all the time. I wouldn't hesitate to order this dish again, but I have to say that I don't think it matters what you order as the quality and taste would be brilliant either way. I have to recommend that you also try the cheese board as the star of the show as the blue cheese which was very very good. I am haven't got a sweeth tooth so didn't try my husbands dish, but he was very happy with his choice. I did have a glass of port to accompany the cheese which matched perfectly well.",5.0

Gives a really intimate vibe- dark decor- nude on the wall- don't think I've seen that in a restaurant before.Food choice fab' & different - licorice ice cream on a starter. Service attentive but low key- you feel as if you are dining at a friends house- loved the butcher block tables- Note: most tables are for 2 - only a few for 4. Don't think a large party would suit as it would overpower the privacy of others. Welcomed with a smoked sherry- then you get the - smoke- thing. Chap across from us was served a glass bell jar with spiralling smoke inside- the waiter slowly raises the dome & smoke diffused - wonderful theatre- Love, love, love this place.",5.0

6811,Brasserie Vacherin,364773781,February 2016,"We must have visited on an off day – I certainly hope this isn't the usual experience. It was a Saturday night and full (we had booked). We were shown to our table, had to ask the waiter to take our coats, were offered water but had to wait 45 minutes without being offered a drink from the bar. We had to ask for a drink and we ordered our food at the same time. Both took an age in coming. The family on the table next to us were also complaining about the long wait for food and when it eventually arrived it took about 3 goes to get the correct potatoes that were ordered. In the end they sent them back as they had finished the rest of their meal! They had, though, been there before and were happy with the previous experience. My own main dish didn't come up correctly and had to be sent back and one of our side dishes was wrong. The waiter was a student and it was his first Saturday night. He kept apologising, but it really wasn't his fault. There didn't seem to be anyone in charge. The food was good, though, when it eventually arrived correctly. We had to query the bill and eventually got some discount. We didn't leave a tip but did give the poor waiter some cash in hand. I hope that eased the pain of the experience for him. The whole evening was quite frustrating and not the relaxing time we were hoping for. Based on this experience, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and it is unlikely that I go back.",1.0

The roast was particularly bland, and the potatoes were really nothing special. The starters were OK-good...and probably the best of the lot.

I had to send the avocado back because it was totally unripe. One of my eggs was also very overcooked and they were so mean with the ham I could hardly tell it was there. In both cases there was barely any hollandaise. How they could have served it with a straight face I'm not sure. I've eaten here for dinner and, while the food wasn't amazing, it was much better.

The restaurant is small, with just six or seven tables and the menu is compact but offers something for everyone. We had the scallops with confit pork cheek (perfectly cooked and the cheek was wonderfully rich) and the cuttlefish with rocket salad (light but flavourful with the pepper from the rocket and a lovely light dressing) to start which were a revelation. The venison burger with blue cheese and malbec onions for main was a wonderfully rich and tasty burger and is right up there with the best burgers i've tried anywhere, served with smokey fries which I've never seen done before. The pork belly was perfectly cooked, the olive mash was atrong enough to stand up to the pork (could've done with a bit more milk to smooth it out a touch more, in my opinion) and was really enjoyable. Dessert: triple chocolate brownie which tasted as good as it sounded. The wine list is compact and the by-the-glass has two sparkling, two white and two red options, all of which are attractively priced.

Well presented menu of game, pork, fish and one vegetarian, the restaurant is next to the local butchers and yes that is where the meat originates from. The menu is online so you can look before you book. Food for 3 courses for 2 was £67, which we think is very reasonable for the quality and area. There is good wine list, again it's online. A great quirk is in the name, smoked fries, a smoked sherry welcome drink and many guests were partaking of a smoked whiskey to finish. So by the end of the evening I was reminded of Scout campfires of my youth! This restaurant is a must if you are visiting Wimbledon, it is a little of the beaten track but for visitors to the tennis, l have checked walking times for you....so 23 minutes from the Tennis, 13 minutes from Wimbledon Park tube station and 11 minutes from Wimbledon station...so go on make a detour for some seriously great food.",5.0

It's an intimate, quite dark restaurant of just 7 tables, but it has a warm vibe and lovely, unhurried and friendly service. Really enjoyed talking with the owner after the meal about the backstory to the restaurant. Lovely complimentary glass of smoked sherry and homemade bread to start. Husband also had a hop and earl grey smoked beer - he said it was fab and a lovely bit of theatre to smoke the glass and deliver it smoking to the table. Food was really terrific. Starters: wood pigeon, rillettes of 3 birds and liquorice ice cream with a pipette of sloe gin was outstanding; scallops and pork cheeks both impeccably cooked, smoked duck salad light and full of flavour. Husband and I had the 13 hour belly pork - amazing - and loved the black olive mash. Daughter had the guinea fowl - terrific and melt in the mouth. Desserts all good too and the cheese board (shared between us) was really well selected - loved the blue cheese drizzled in white truffle honey. Great, fairly priced wine list and some lovely 'stickies' to go with dessert or coffee. A great birthday for my husband. Holy Smoke deserves its growing reputation and to do well.

6851,Brasserie Vacherin,358526872,March 2016,"Having read the previous reviews for BV, we weren't sure what to expect, but we were very pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating. We were a party of 7, celebrating a birthday and they were more than happy to accept our own bought cake and serve it at the right moment. They all spoke good English and explained anything on the menu that we couldn't translate (it is ALL in French). We can't have been the easiest customers, with very varied requests, but they were helpful and polite, unlike some of the other reviews suggest. The food was amazing, beautifully cooked and presented and we all enjoyed our choices. Parking is difficult as it's on a main road, so we took the chance of parking in Morrison's supermarket car park (almost opposite) as this was free for 2 hours. We were a bit longer but, luckily, hadn't been clamped or received the £100 fine threatened! The food's quite expensive so we mostly chose the 2 course menu for £15.95 or 3 courses for £19.95 (a special weekday offer) which made it affordable. You have to be careful which dishes come WITH potatoes and veg, some do and some don't, and these add ons come at a price! It wasn't very busy, being a Wednesday lunch time so maybe that helped improve the waiter service? I would recommend this restaurant and would definitely visit again if in the area.",5.0

From the outset the service was not what I would expect from this type of what appears to be 'fine dining' restaurant. None of the waiters were rude or unpleasant but all seemed to be clueless and failed to do a waiters job. At no point were we asked if we needed anything or if the food was alright. We had to keep hunting down staff to ask for everything which after the first few times got a little frustrating. I even highlighted this quite early on to the manager hoping that this would put an end to it but it did not. ""Can we have some drinks?"", ""can we have some bread?"", ""can we have a fork?"" You get my drift. Unfortunately the food did not make the experience any more bearable. It was distinctly average and the only part which I enjoyed was the dessert. The steak was served with a knife that could not cut it, the soup served without bread, the burger was completely dry and tasteless and one of the desserts was brought out incorrect twice (it was only sorbet with berries). They were not incredibly busy so there is no excuse, and I feel like they drafted in temp staff to cover what they hoped would be a busy day but unfortunately the temp staff they got have never worked in catering before. I will not be going back and and I will not be recommending this restaurant at all. This ruined what was supposed to be a celebratory lunch for our Mums and it just leaves a bitter taste in the mouth... gutted",1.0
6873,Holy Smoke,355515943,March 2016,"The intimate atmosphere was cozy and comfortable and not the slightest pretentious. Our waiter started us with a smoked sherry and if you like smoky flavors, you will love this aperitif and the extensive list of whiskies is adventurous. We started with drunken beets and the wood pigeon appetizers which were both lovely. Confit pork belly could use a touch more ginger and chili but was superb, however the roasted guinea fowl was other worldly with a deep, complex sauce and meat that was tenderly marinated. My husband is still talking about it. The wine list is thoughtful and well rounded and the wine we chose paired perfectly with our entrees. The seating times and course deliveries are methodical and not rushed but we did run out of time to partake in dessert. A truly wonderful dining experience and we look forward to returning alone and with friends.",5.0

We decided to go with the normal menu and the food was of an amazing quality. My issue was with the staff. They were too attentive! Leaning over our shoulders every 5 mins, taking things from our table before we had even finished drinking or eating. When the waitress went to remove my plate, the knife fell off and went down my top, leaving a smear of food on my new top. I didnt get an apology just a broken english ""are u ok?"". She then stepped up the attentiveness to the point where we both felt like we were being rushed out the restaurant. The longest time we were left alone was strangely when they were getting the bill for us! The food and drink, especially the cocktails are amazing, but the customer service was too full on.

Food was good as always with the exception of 1 or 2 things but the new manager was so patronising it's un true and spoke to me like I was born yesterday. Spinach came out cold had to be sent back we had the chateaubriand which on some parts tasted burnt but didn't complain. Then at the end I asked for a desert wine and it had sediment in it. The waiter (who was really nice) was instructed by the manager to inform me that they do not like to SIFT wine as it will remove flavour..... that was the final straw for me. £160 bill for 2 people is high so you expect high service.

The starters and wine were excellent, but upon receiving the 230g (8oz) steak at nearly £14, it was exceptionally disappointing. Once the thick layer of fat was removed. There were approximately three mouthfulls. At this price (which was for the piece of meat only- any sides were an expensive optional extra), this was unacceptable. The frustration comes when I approached one of the restaurant staff, and very discretely and apologetically explained that we weren't happy, she came to out table, apologised and said ""the chef has informed me that this is how the steaks come now"". Although an offer of something else was given (no point when you're out as a couple because both end up eating alone, or having cold food), if a customer is unhappy, any form of excuse is not acceptable, and ruins an evening.

The food was extremely and impressively excellent - the kind where you savor every tiny mouthful. The icing on the cake is the great value.

The food is always good, sometimes a little bit lacking in attention to detail, and they're always stingy with the bearnaise sauce.

BV used to have very good, consistent and reliable staff, who recognised us when we visited, knew our preferences, and we very attentive. The service is lacking to what it was 18 months ago, and we often find ourselves asking things that were once a 'standard'.

Began with a glass of prosecco followed by thoughtfully presented starters. There is a 12.5% compulsory service charge at this restaurant and whilst the service itself is attentive enough (they keep topping up your glasses) this doesn't mean very much if it takes an absolute age to get the next course out to you! For a prix fixe menu the mains of rump steak frites and saucisses with Puy lentils were more than satisfactory but there was then another inordinate wait for the dessert. I'd previously asked for the cheese to be taken out of the fridge so that it came at ambient temperature but seemingly they must have forgotten about this as after another long wait it finally came on a warm board sweating suspiciously and almost semi-cooked. Not nice. My wife's pot au chocolat by contrast was ice cold apparently.And this was on a Monday night too. A quick, cheap 'en cas' type meal had taken 1. 75 hours to complete which is far too long.

We all had the rump steak frites but it is literally steak and thin fries and we were glad we ordered some extra vegetables. I would say the steaks were cooked on the rarer side of what we ordered but better that than burned for me.

We arrived at 7pm and the waitress asked if we wanted our Prossecco straight away. As we were waiting for one of my daughters to arrive we said could we have it when she came. She arrived 10 mins later. At this time there were only a few people in the restaurant and lots of waiters/waitresses appearing to be standing around, so when she didn't appear I had to ask for the drinks. Then we had to ask to order. Not sure why as they weren't that busy. Eventually ordered mussels all four of us. But we had to wait at least half an hour before they came! Sorry but mussels don't take that long. By the time we had eaten our starters it was about 8 pm and there were more people in the restaurant. We then had to wait until 8.45 pm to get our main courses and then 9.30 pm before we got our desserts! Having arrived at 7pm leaving at about 9.45/50 pm is not really acceptable especially when we first arrived there weren't many people to serve and waiters/waitresses hanging around doing nothing! I can only assume that they were down on numbers in the kitchen as most people that night had the same problem. Surely at least an apology for delays would have been the least they could have done. Not sure who was actually managing the restaurant that evening either because it seemed to be only young people waiting and nobody in charge. When we ordered our desserts which we had all chosen the Pot au Chocolat the waiter said that we would have to wait at least 20 minutes because they would have to be cooked freshly! I laughed as I knew he had got the wrong dessert as they just come out of the fridge! But no we had to wait about half an hour. Then they had the cheek to add 12.5% service - for what? The food however was mostly very good and we all enjoyed it, except for one of my daughters who had the sausage which seemed to be uncooked (it was pink inside) but was told by the waiter who had checked with the chef that it was cooked twice whatever that means! She still didn't eat much of it. One other thing is that we had the Menu Prix Fixe but had to pay extra for vegetables - sorry but this is supposed to be a fixed price surely this should include vegetables and not just chips!

We were charged at the higher rate. When I pointed the discrepancy out, the manager told us that we were liable because the need to ask for a separate menu was printed (in smaller print) below the Price Fixe label. We challenged this, saying that we had indicated our interest in the Price Fixe menu, but had not been shown that by the waiter. I requested that the menu be adjusted to the price Fixe level. The manager went away, and returned to say that both waiters had confirmed that we had been show the menu (we had only been served by one). We were compelled to bay the full menu price minus he discretionary service charge, and told we should appreciate the effort they spent to accommodate my wife by preparing (initially incorrectly) a salad and fruit salad. Afterwards, the waiter who served us avoided my gaze, looked away and blushed, from which you may draw your own conclusions.

I was looked after from my very first visit and in time I have become a regular, welcomed always with a smile and same consistent hospitality as a new customer, without a sense of familiarity. I was mesmerised by the choices on the menu firstly, but mostly the freshness of the fish and seafood dishes is what makes me come back. The scallops are my favourite, the lobster and the succulent steaks are something you won't find in many restaurants around the area for the prices offered. I have to say this is not a restaurant to be compared with what is on high street, it is run independently and has something outstanding to offer from the food to the amazing service. Staff are polite, helpful and smiley, it gets to the point of them remembering even what i had on my last visit! I felt it was unfair to judge negatively this restaurant by some of the reviews written, that does not express anything but a lack of understanding and knowledge of fresh food. What this venue has to offer worths the wait on a busy Saturday evening especially, bearing in mind it is fully booked, the service is very good and not to forget the terrace at the back where you can smoke quietly, without being disturbed by the vibrant noisy high street and where you can take your drink too... I had my birthday party there after having been offered a customised menu to suit my needs and I would recommend it to anyone that like their special event celebrated in style and have a great time also. Overall I wish the area I live in would have a venue like this that make foodies pleased and happy, may i suggest you consider opening one in Surbiton at some stage... Nonetheless it's definitely the place to dine or grab a quick lunch too, with their 3 courses prix fixe menu that offers quite a wide range to choose from.

It was difficult to get staffs' attention for drinks and we waited at least half an hour for our mains to come.

The duck egg creme creme brulee was exceptional. The restaurant has a certain elegance once past the disappointing exterior facade, but decor is rather dark and tables rustic. Although leaving the door open during lunch aired the small interior, the traffic noise intruded.

But on each occasion we have visited we have felt the service has left a bit to be desired. This time was no different. It was attentive but brusque. we requested 2 glasses of champagne and both glasses were given to my wife, still water was topped with sparkly water and they failed 100% to place the right food in front of us for each course apart from dessert.

This made us feel very welcome and would not have been the case in some other restaurants especially in some chains. The food was incredible. The portions look small but the food is very rich and we didn't have room for desert (we might come back and have mains and desert). My sister had the vegetarian options which were delicious. I had squid to start which, as a big squid eater, I can say was some of the best I have ever had.

Limited selection of drinks, food was nice on the whole but portions are not generous and most main courses require ordering at least one side dish which puts the price up - in my opinion main courses should come with potatoes and a selection of vegetables and then people can order extra things if they wish. Lamb shanks and pork belly were delicious, sea bass was a bit dry as there was not enough sauce and no wedge of lemon. Salted caramel tart came with a very tiny blob of crème fraiche, but bread and butter pudding was delicious and boozy but £5.25 if ordered off menu and £5.95 if ordered off blackboard?? Enjoyable meal but we have had better for the price considering we only had a small carafe of wine.

There are some great ingredients used in the cooking here, but unfortunately they seem to have been overly pretentious with the menu by mixing ingredients that simply don't go together. The prices are a bit higher than average here, which is most notable with starters and desserts.

We opted for the 3-course light lunch and really liked the way that you could mix and match this with the regular menu to give a little more variety. We started with a glass of champagne then both had a glass of red wine which was included in the lunch menu and was really nice a full bodied.

The staff were very nice, service was a bit slow but the place had a nice buzz inside. The food, in some respects, is quite good. The fish dishes look great and I regret not choosing this option as my Sussex Lamb was the toughest I have ever tasted, so much so that I sent it back as it was inedible and full of gristle. Initially the waitress brought it back to me and said that the chef would not be cooking me a fresh piece as ""that was what the cut of lamb was like."" When I pointed out that I was fully aware of the nature of the cut of the meat, that it was impossible to cut, full of gristle and that I would refuse to pay for it as it was the worst piece of lamb ever presented to me in any restaurant...then it was returned to the kitchen for a second time and a new piece cooked for me. Anyone could see how tough the meat was and to initially refuse my complaint with a patronising excuse on the cut of the meat, was bad customer service and quite frankly, a damn cheek. However, my companions meals looked fine and the sorbet desert was delicious. Bit hit and miss to be honest, not a bad meal overall but certainly had a lot better, on terms of quality of food and customer service.",3.0

First they said they didn't have any menus so left us, without taking a drinks order. Then they brought menus to share, then we all got one but still we had to ask if we could order some drinks. Apart from a decent drinks order, we asked for a couple of jugs of water for the table, particularly for one of my daughters as she doesn't drink. Four times we had to ask for the water, yet when we finished one of the bottles of wine, they were there offering a new bottle in no time. The starter didn't take too long but we waited over an hour after that for our main course. the people who didn't have a starter were starving and then we didn't all get our meal at the same time. People who came in after us were served first. The staff were polite but when we quietly asked where our food was, the waitress apologised but did nothing about it. Such a shame as the food was really good when it eventually arrived. Something we have never done before, we asked for the hefty 12.5% service charge to be removed.

The service is superb, even for a small independent restaurant. The passion for food and ambience runs through the whole restaurant, from front of house through to the kitchen. The managers are extremely knowledgable and are clearly foodies themselves. The quality and thought doesn't end at the food however. The ever growing wine list is extremely well thought out and there is a wine to suit any palette. The value is truly outstanding though, with some great wines at a fraction of the price you would expect to pay in a restaurant of this quality. Saving the best until last though, the whiskey list is lovingly put together and every whiskey comes with its own smoke...! They start from as little as a couple of quid for a single malt so if you are lucky enough to be eating here please do not discount an after dinner drink.

It was all beautifully presented & tasted wonderful . I don't drink but some of the other customers had smoked whiskys which were brought out in large smoke filled jars & when the jars were removed the room filled with a wonderful aroma.

The menu offers a well-thought out selection that gives an eclectic twist on classic dishes and we will be returning to explore further. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, but most importantly is truly passionate about food, drink and their restaurant.

7186,Brasserie Vacherin,209766787,June 2014,"We recently visited the restaurant which i booked for my partner's birthday and i must say i we left somewhat disapointed. Let me start with positives: pleasant, not intrusive staff.Lovely ambience, very clean and spacious dining area. Good selection of wine reasonably priced. Food presented very well. However.. the food itself, we found underseasoned & very small portions. when you order a main course, you literally are getting what it says on the menu in the middle of your plate and any extra veg,sides etc are to be paid extra. when you pay £15 plus for a main course you would expect for more on your plate. we all ordered a starter and main course, bottle of wine and it all came up to £140 (hidden optional service charge included) and left not fully satisfied and feeling peckish. dont get me wrong, overall experience i would rate for about 65-70% positive but i think there is a room for improvement when it comes to food itself. i live in Sutton and for a while have wanted to try them out, now i did and sadly i dont think i will be returning.

We were not sure if children would be allowed but I figured its common in France and I know my 2 year old daughter is well behaved for her age. Sure enough she was mesmerized by the calming ambience and the soothing music. Whilst my wife and I tucked into the delicious mushroom crostini starter and possibly the best beef burger I have ever tasted my daughter polished off the bread and olive oil. The menu is excellent and prices are reasonable considering the quality is michelin standard. The owners are so friendly and a real pleasure to chat to. You may be thinking a burger isnt something you would find in a michelin standard restaurant.... Gourmet burger is a phrase that has been overused by upmarket pubs over the years..... Trust me, the Holy smoke burger is a culinary masterpiece. It took me a while to guess what cut of beef Cameron used for the dish but it is more tender than fillet and tastier than rib eye and I'm going to keep it a secret. Cameron spent months trying out diferent cuts of beef to put the dish together. Well done. We will be back soon to sample some other delights.",5.0

Very nice bread, very good scallops, excellent venison and dauphinoise potatoes and a creme brûlée with a sugar crust so thick it was like toffee apple which I happen to like.

The lunch became a little disjointed as unfortunately, two of our steaks had to be returned as they were not medium cooked and I had trouble cutting mine even with a steak knife. We assumed they would throw the meat back in the pan and return it to us. Amazingly...we were given two new steaks and...fresh frites to go with them. These were more like the quality we had hoped to receive and we enjoyed the meal very much although the others had to wait for us to finish. The red wine was very smooth and drinkable.

There was only two of us, and in the restaurant there was only 3 other groups, so not busy. really didn't feel happy about that. especially as these add ons go straight into the managers pockets, (most of it).

My wife had a poached pear starter which contained 2 wafer thin slices of pear. The service was slow.

Being a tastecard member we opted for here, considering a number of friends had recommended it. We were NOT dissapointed. From the moment you walk in, there is an ambiance of class, from the decor right through to the french waiters who greet you and seat you in a fashion of what you'd expect from a top west end restaurant, possibly better. We were given complimentary bread with an anchovy butter, something different but lovely. then on to the food. The misses had scallops with black pudding and crispy bacon with pear puree, the black pudding was like i'd never had before, it was smooth with chunks, although it may not sound lovely, it really was. I had ravioli with crab and leek and it was quite honestly devine. For mains we both opted for steak, ribeye for me, my favourite cut, which was well cut and cooked, she had filet tail which she had loads of, both lovely. We opted for 4 sides, fries, lovely, dauphiniose, crispy cheesy well season, chilli brocolli, and imaginative but lovely combo, and mushrooms flavoured for oregano which really made a bland vegetable very appertising. All were cooked perfectly. as the food was so good, we both decided on deserts. I opted for prune and armangac (excue my spelling) bread and butter pudding (immense flavours) and she had chocolate fondant with amaretto ice, again perfect. We had 2 bottle of wine, the cheapest on the menu at £16.95, but it was amazing, so nice i noted the name to buy for home. I am already arranging my next visit here, and for the first time ever, was totally happy with everything. Which leads me to the price. I'm not one who minds paying for quality, and have paid 5 times as much for half the quality. the bill came to £93 with tip, with my old faithful tastecard which gave me £30 off.

Our table was booked for 30 mins after opening time when we were told that the chef still had not arrived!! So we were sat in the bar area to drink coffee when another gentleman arrived and was seated straight at a table! He was then served his FULL ENGLISH BREAKFAST before our Eggs Benedict and when our eggs benedict arrived they were stone cold! Not just the ham but the eggs themselves, the muffins and the hollandaise sauce. This is not at all what I expect so I sent it back at which point we could hear the chef (who looks and sounds like he has a real bad attitude) telling the waiter that the dish was 'supposed to be cold'. But they cooked up fresh ones anyway. When these arrived the eggs were overcooked but I couldn't be bothered to complain again and just ate it anyway. They kindly gave me 50% off my food bill but I was so disappointed having had such a great experience here in the past.

Well we had plenty of time for the catch up at this restaurant. We had booked a table for 8.00pm. We sat there for an hour before a waiter came near us. At which point we had to ask if someone could come and serve us. We ordered wine and water. We had ordered two bottles of white and a red. The whites were from different countries so when they were brought to the table we needed to assess which one was which. The waiter was absolutely clueless. We simply asked which one was the Australian? He did not seem to understand. After we had established which bottle was which he simply poured it and walked away. After sampling the wine we realised it was warm - not chilled. The price we were paying was not cheap!! We could not seem to get the attention of a waiter so I went up to the main counter and explained that the wine was warm. Again, blank looking faces not understanding what I was saying. A woman then stepped in. I think she was the manager. After some time another bottle was brought to the table. We finished what was left in our glasses and proceeded to pour our own wine. At this point we still hadn't ordered any food. We eventually got our starters at 9.50pm. Yes that's right nearly two hours after we had arrived. We had to chase our main courses and decided not to bother with puddings as we thought we might be there until breakfast!!!! We eventually got the bill somewhere around midnight with service charge included. We called the woman over (The Manager we think) and told her we were paying £50 a couple and that was it. The service had been appalling the food was OK but nothing to shout home about plus we had been there for four hours!! It is fair to say we will be bothering again and would advise people to avoid this place unless they are happy waiting hours for food and don't mind being ignored by the staff. Appalling!!!!",2.0

My husband did, he had a lobster lunch the day before, was full of praise, so much so, that took me the next day for the same. As we came the sign outside still advertised the whole lobster. We ordered and settled at the waiting area by the window. I have to mention that we did not want to have any alcohol as we were heading to a funeral afterwards, but that did not go down very well. There were no juices and very limited non-alcoholic drinks selection. I also did not want fries with the lobster. Still can't understand why the waiter did not think that was a reasonable request in this age of no carbs dieting. We settled on a side dish of rocket. However five minutes later the waiter came to announce that the lobster have not arrived that day and they have no idea where is the driver. Well, we went to an Italian place across the road and did not regret. I have to say there is more to a good establishment than just excellent food.

Menus had to be printed so a further wait ensued. This experience echoes that of No1 daughter the previous week. The deal was 3 courses + a glass of fizz and, at £23 each, was excellent value. Scallops were plump and juicy and huge. The cassoulet was filling and unctuous. Dessert was a selection of sorbets and ice cream which was a poor choice from the variety of dishes on offer. Other diners chose different dishes from the Dinner Deal menu and opted for side dishes to go with their mains. These are expensive so its easy to rack up the bill. Wines by the glass and bottle start at reasonable prices. Water in a jug freely given and replenished without asking. Tasty bread with anchovy butter and plain butter is gratis.

7372,Maggie Jones's,579047739,May 2018,"I took my Thai friends here when they were visiting London, as I knew the restaurant had a great, royal history and served classical English food. We took a little while to find the place, as it is a little tucked away up a side street, and we were not disappointed by the quirky decor after we entered and were shown up the windy wooden stairs to the first floor. Everything is low lighting, aged wood and plenty of hanging decorations (dried bundles of flowers and so on). The service was pleasant, and the food fine: I had the crab and avocado starter, followed by steak and chips and rounded off with bread and butter pudding. I had two bottles of London Pride, and my bill came to nearly £60, which I thought too much. £25 for steak and chips? There were many tourists eating there, so perhaps that is why the prices are so steep.",3.0

7374,Brasserie Vacherin,157581962,April 2013,"We went here on Thursday, using our taste card, excited at the recent reviews of the restaurant. We told our waitress that we had an hour and a half before we were off to catch a film. Normally two courses in a. Hour and a half would normally be ample time, but it took them 45 mins to serve our starter! We ordered the soufflé, the only good thing we had with any flavour and the moules mariniere. The moules were not remotely fresh and sauce was bland and watery. The main was pumpkin knocci, which was positively foul, chewy and the sauce la led flavour, I strongly suspect they had run out of pumpkin, As it was barely noticeable. The steak pave was a good cut, poorly cooked to medium and the garlic sauce was a gloopy Luke warm under flavoured mess. The chips were greasy and my partner had a hankering for potatoes dauphinois, they were laughable with two thin slices of potatoe and a sprinkling of cheese. We sat next to another regular diner who had decided to try the taste card, having been a regular diner there she explained that the experience she had with the taste card was very different to the norm. The discretionary (but keys face it, who argues these?) was £8 for service that would barely surpass in a nandos. All on all thoroughly dissapointing, and we were looking forward to it, given its recent good reviews. What a shame.",2.0

7376,Maggie Jones's,563990227,February 2018,This restaurant is a rare treat in Kensington with a good selection of traditional English fare. On a rather cold London evening after going to a show the restaurant has plenty to choose from on the menu although slightly disappointed as a couple of things I would have had were in the process of being removed as the menu is changing. We started with the tart of the day and a pate both of which were good sized portions. Two of our party had Liver and Bacon for the main course which was excellent one had the stuffed chicken and I had the pie of the day. Was a little disappointed as my pie turned out to be a casserole without pastry and if I had known I would have plumped for the liver. We later heard a different waiter explain to another table that it was a casserole but that was too late for us. One of our ordered side dishes dishes did not turn up but given that the others were healthy portions this wasn’t too much of an issue.,3.0

7384,Brasserie Vacherin,150771614,November 2012,"Lets face it, there's nothing else in Sutton that can match this place. It's as if Malcolm John has chosen gourmet wastelands to try and build a reputation and he certainly succeeded with this and Le Cassoulet in South Croydon. The latter has now closed leaving only Alberts Table if you want something to write home about. This place offers a menu Prix fixe which is good value if a little limited and their wine list needs a reasonably priced house wine to go with it. Staff are friendly, the atmosphere is authentically French and the food very good but there are jarring moments like terrible fries, tiny portions of vegetables which should be cheaper, charging twice for bread if you ask for more ( ask yourself which was the last actual French restaurant you went to where they charged you for bread instead of putting it on the table as often as you emptied the basket.) But, smoked haddock lovely, scallops with black pudding also, so overall very good. One final quibble is that the automatic 12.5 per cent service goes to the management rather than the person who serves you which is a practice that ought to be outlawed.",4.0

I asked for mine to be medium - well done cooked however it was very rare. I told the waiter this and he took it back to the kitchen. Having waited another 10 minutes he brought it back to me to find it was still very rare. Surely the chef knows the difference?? The waiter argued with me saying it was medium to well done and I was shocked by his poor attitude. My friend had ordered the same as me and having compared both steaks mine was def bloody and rare. At this point everyone had nearly finished their meal. The thing that upset me the most was the attitude of our waiter. He couldn’t care less that he had ruined our meal and so we left without me eating anything. I will not be going back here again after being a loyal customer for a long time.

Being a regular, the service is always good, but I noticed there seemed a bit of friction between the staff when I was there. I arrived late, and the specials we requested were no longer available, so I ordered a steak and my wife ordered the duck confit. My steak was cooked as requested, and was nice, however, the duck confit was extremely salty, so my wife sent it back.

Portions were generous, and none of us left hungry! Considering the quality and quantity of the food, allied with the attentive and helpful staff and the overall atmosphere, this restuarnat is actually very good value.

On top of this, the customer service was appalling! Our waitress remained steeley faced the whole evening, never breaking a smile and made my family feel at unease. I got the impression that this restaurant was designed by pretentious people, for pretentious people, who don't really have much clue of what makes good customer service and what makes good French food. I would have been less harsh, had it not been so over priced, but the prices are completely unjustifiable given the standard of food and labelling itself a Brasserie!?",3.0

Dishes seem reasonably priced until you realise you've forgotten about the veg at £3.00 for each 'example' ( ie small splat of mash that probably cost about 5 pence). Last mistake was going early evening . One of my dining companions was given what was probably left over from lunch service. The service was minimal.

I was unaware until we were actually there that everything is gluten free. Everything. Even the tasty bread assortment. Normally you can tell if bread is sans gluten; there's that cardboard texture that's the give away. Not here. When we had the cheeseboard, the crackers were the tastiest I'd ever had.

The service isn't always great but every meal I have had has been enjoyable. We had oysters last night and I was a bit wary not eating them in a seafood restaurant but they were as fresh as a daisy,lovely. One issue for me is that my absolute favourite sweet Iles flottante has been withdrawn from the menu I am so disappointed as it's impossible to find anywhere else. I hope someone from the management reads this and takes pity!! One last gripe is the bare windows at the front.

The waitress actually rolled her eyes at my daughter for her choice of main course and when I asked why she said, “she seriously wants to order THAT? Well, I don’t like it”. Astonishing!

I was surprised that only one other table (in the upstairs area) was occupied as I had anticipated a place buzzing with locals. For the most part the food was not up to the expected standard. My cod was slightly overcooked and served with great chunks of undercooked carrot and new potatoes. My crab and avocado starter was very good. My daughter-in-law's veg pot pie was also a disappointment - more undercooked carrot. My wife thought the soup tasted like canned and her veg tart (quiche) was greasy.

To say the service was bad is a understatement my treatment and my friends whilst at the restaurant was shocking. we arrived at 4.30pm on a sunday ordered our 3 course meal and 2 cocktails each, now at 7pm we were still waiting for our dessert and had already waited 20mins for our drinks qe ordered as soon as we were seated we had to prompt the waiters everytime in to which the response was rude abrupt and abusive to which i had to say that the level of respect and the quality of customer service was non existant to which a waiter came over and did apoligise which i appreciated and thanked and said i understood. but after going to the toilet and then outside for a cigeratte whilst waiting for the dessert upon returning we asked to speak to the manager as we felt the service and standard they were giving was not right also i forgot to mention a very drunk gentleman entered the premises and ordered bottles of red wine to say he was highly intoxicated is a understatement considering he stumbled inside and then he passed out and fell asleep on the table which then led to him falling down onto the sofa. now during our conversation with the manager a fellow dinner then felt he was superior and had a right to become aggressive and verbally attacked myself and my 2 friends who were also female. now during this incident we were told to f*** off by this man and his wife who then went on to verbally abuse us, to which the manager just stood their and allowed this to happen and even seemed to enjoy it. Now to say this was a discrimination against how we looked would be to hit a nail on the head. im hugely disgruntled by this as i am usually a very happy customer and dont ever seem to allow little things to bother me however in this situation i feel its only right as we should not have been subjected to this abuse on such a highly viewed establishment. to then see the manager over look us who had been there for 3 hours to then deal with a couple who had just arrived 30mins prior was very insulting and shows that they dont give much conaideration to all customers just a very selective few of a certain class. the interesting thing is i was there 3 days prior therefore i must say it is not recommended to visit or dine due to this disgusting experience and poor character judgement on the restaurants behalf.",1.0

The desserts capped off a very satisfying culinary experience with their chocolate fondant and cherry and almond tart, both served warm with vanilla ice cream.... positively yummy!! The only thing better was, rather refreshingly, the patience and unintrusive attention of the two waiting staff attending our table throughout the evening.

The positives are that the inside was beautiful with candles and old farm-style decor, our server was lovely and the food genuinely delicious. I was unimpressed with the extreme lack of options for vegetarians (roast vegetables is not a main meal) but the one other option was a pie which is fine. My reasoning for such a low rating is my anger at the hidden costs. The pie was £14 to begin with, and when ordering was asked what side of vegetables I would like. At that price it seemed reasonable that the cost of this was included, but no. The bill came and I was charged an extra £5 for a bowl of green beans which is ludicrous, plus there is a £1 cover charge per person (who still does cover charges??) and a 12.5% tip added on. Particularly as students these hidden charges really really stung for us and turned what was a nice meal into a sour memory. These charges should be made clear, or better yet not charged at all.

An innovative concept based around smoked cooking, knowledgeable and welcoming service and excellent value are all huge plus points but the execution of the food in my view could definitely have been improved. £12 for the lunch menu for two courses is great value, and with a smoked sherry to start it could not be better. But the goat's cheese salad with pomegranate cream dressing and granola nuts was very dry and lacked quantity on the dressing which was a shame. Warm, crusted goat's cheese would have been nice too. The main of pulled pork with coleslaw and black bean risotto again was a delicious idea and the main part of the pork was cooked and seasoned to perfection. But the black beans and the rice in the risotto were under-cooked and not seasoned and there could have been more coleslaw, which, like the pork was also delicious.

Once inside you're greeted by friendly waiters and waitresses in a rather intimate setting, which doesn't seat more than 20-25. And the food - absolutely spectacular. The small loaf of bread and butter which is usually offered to guests upon being seated, is soft and fluffy, hits all the spots. The guinea fowl - just lush and mouth-meltingly good. One really can't fault the presentation of the food, the taste and the service.I would dine here every night if I could. Can't wait to dine here again for my birthday next month.

We were fans of the Brasserie Vacherin in Croydon when it was owned by Chef Malcolm John but have now transferred our allegiance following his sale there. The restaurant at Sutton is bigger, and lighter, and stretches back a long way from the narrow frontage. Yesterday they were offering Sunday platters of roast meats, but we opted to go for the a la carte menu. From this I had a liver pate and my wife a generous helping of scallops as our starters. My main course was chicken and the dessert a date and almond tart. Both lovely. We drank a nice chenin blanc. Service was attentive and we were recognised by Irina who previously worked at the Croydon outlet. It was refreshing to see Malcolm John making a couple of visits and overseeing what his restaurant was offering. As we left we observed that most tables were occupied.

It also seemed quirky. How pleased we were to find it half full at 1pm on a weekday. We were greeted with a smile and shown to our rustic but very functional table, and were told a brief amusing history of the resturant. They serve house wines by the magnum, paying for what you drink, again an excellent offer. Serving traditional food can be a problem as many people cook their own versions at home and with some trepidation I chose the onion soup, pork belly and bread and butter pudding, all favourites and ones i have cooked a dozen times. All were excellent. The soup was the right size, as so many resturants overdo onion soup and it becomes a meal in itself. The pork was succulent and the crackling crisp, and the pudding was light, and came with real custard. Our partners were equally pleased with their choices of the sausage and mash and others. I should also recommend the maitre d and the waiting staff, as at one point, the table next to us were conducting a video conference call - can you believe it - and requested a bit of quiet!

For dessert I had a sponge cake with almonds and some alcohol in it. Since I don't like alcohol mixed with sweet stuff obviously I wasn't a big fan, but the shepherds pie was made just right. There are a lot of innovative and new age places in greater London, so innovative that it's hard to find this type of food in the center. It's just not as common as in used to be, and this is what makes Maggie Jones so unique and special. Don't get it wrong though as this isn't a a place that charges like a pub does.

I like mine medium but mine still had a pulse and lost the will to live trying to cut it. I've never been to a restaurant that gives you butter with you bread full of anchovies!!! Yuckkk. The drinks are so pricey too £8.00 for a single drink. Won't be booking here again.,2.0

Vegetables have to be ordered and paid for separately (how quaintly old-fashioned); I had very overcooked spinach. My husband described his liver as OK. The place is dark and dingy and we sat on a wobbly bench right next to a fridge that they appeared not to have room for in the kitchen. Service was willing enough but very slow.

The place appears to be winding down for closure. On arriving for our pre-meal drinks at the bar we were told there was no draught beer at all so ordered a Club and Ginger Ale. No ginger ale. A G&T then? A choice of only 2 cheap gins. My starter came incomplete (terrine without gherkins because 'the chef forgot'). For main I wanted a sirloin - no sirloin, because 'the order hasn' t come yet!' as advised unapologetically by a humourless waitress that was making it very obvious she wanted to get away because her boyfriend was waiting in the bar. So I plumped for rump which was impossible to calve with the blunt butter knife I'd been given. Had to beg for a steak knife from the owner himself who seemed exasperated with his staff's incompetence. In spite of us being one of only two couples dining (popular, eh?) the steak was cold and frites criminally over-salted to the point of thirst-inducing. Suffice to say we paid up without service charge and will be looking for a better venue for our Christmas Eve lunch next year. I feel sorry for the poor people that have put trust in this place for their Christmas Day lunch tomorrow. Not so Michelin as middling. Avoid!",1.0

Cool little place, character, friendly staff. The furnishings are rustic, which has somewhat of a double meaning.. Old tables, chairs, plates, silverware etc. It's very close to just being old and worn out, with the usual chair and table wobbles and mismatching cutlery. This would be cool if it was priced accordingly, but it definitely isn't. At £40 each for a basic meal, 1 drink and desert, it's right up there. Again, possibly OK for Kensington... If the food was any good. My meal was a piece of rump steak, poorly seasoned, cooked OK, but little flavour and relatively tough. Small by NZ, AUS and US standards, fairly overlooked chips. The other meals looked similarly unappealing. Shepherds pie, come on, how can you justify those prices. But, they also had a really interesting selection of game meats, and my friend enjoyed his Guinea fowl. In NZ, or AUS this place would have died out long ago, probably somewhere back in the 1980's.

The restaurant can cater for couples, groups and larger parties and we have celebrated a few big occasions there and would highly recommend it for whatever size party you are.

Don't be put off by the website saying they are full (which seems odd) as when I arrived on Wednesday lunch I was the only person there. While it was good value I wouldn't go out my way to visit, its position in the top 10 on Tripadvisor is very flattering I would say. Nothing wrong with it but it didn't stand out.

Our friends knew the restaurant having worked in the area and as a very jaded Londoner I expected the normal modern, flash spot and was hugely, pleasantly surprised. It is awesome. If you can imagine one of those old travellers inns on the road side with little hideaways, wood on every side with items of interest wherever you look. What impressed me was not one of these items was dusty or full of cobwebs. A carefully cultivate atmosphere. You walk in and feel welcome, warm and taken care of. We had 2 x 8 year olds and 4 year old. They don’t have a kids menu but were just so accommodating. You can order lots of little plates or a delicious steak and share. The menu is small but varied with everything from the mentioned steak, amazing fresh fish, venison, pie just as a flavour. Not expensive or cheap just right and great wine. The restaurant is across 3 floors with about 5 tables per floor. Very french which is seen everywhere from the manager who greets you at the door, the waiters and the precision and balance of the food.

Roast pork belly is a must-order-dish!! The serving of the main courses are quite a lot for me and my husband though but they tasted really good.

The menu has remained the same all this time - home cooked, high quality traditional hearty fare, focused particularly on roasted meat and salmon. Go careful with the side veg, you will always order more than you can eat because the food is so hearty. A nice touch is the nibbles to start - crudités with a tangy dip and a thick cut farmhouse bread and butter before the main event which could be roast chicken, rack of lamb or salmon with hollandais. The puddings are traditional and hearty too - eg crumble or burnt cream (creme brûlée).

There is some construction in front of the restaurant which detracts from the look of the street. But the restaurant interior definitely met all my expectations of a quaint English restaurant. Each of the three floors is decorated with lots of wood accents that seem to just fit the style and the mood. Each floor has a small number of beautifully crafted smooth pine tables each accented with tall elegant candles. We had a a reservation for a group of 7 and sat at a wide table with ample room on the first floor. Our waiters were wonderful and took the time to explain the ingredients in each of the dishes. The menu is comprised of many English specialties and everything is priced a la carte. Bread and vegetable sticks are served to the table. We ordered a variety of appetizers and vegetables--liver pate, melted stilton cheese, asparagus, cauli-flower with cheese, and chips and all were delicious. The rack of lamb was scrumptious, juicy and tender, and cooked the way we requested. The chicken pot pie with artichoke was another meal hit--nice flaky pastry and a tasty pot pie sauce.

7812,Maggie Jones's,380770492,June 2016,"Dined at Maggie Jones this week with my wife, daughter and son-in-law - selected on the basis of trip advisor. I'm afraid I just cannot provide any truly positive feedback. Obviously it is pitched at ""hearty English food"" with a broad selection of roasts and traditional pie. The decor is interesting and welcoming. Starters of mushroom soup were adequate without being particularly interesting, onion tart has no discernible onion either in texture or flavour - quite band. For main courses we were 2 x venison and 2 x roast pork shoulder. The pork was adequate - standard sunday roast and vegetables overcooked, with watery mash. Mash could have been spiced up with virtually anything - truffle oil, garlic, parmesan you name it.. but no. The venison was much anticipated but was left largely untouched by both - it had a particularly bitter taste that rendered it inedible and all agreed was unlike any venison ever tasted (not in a good way..). Waiter cleared without commenting that the food was largely untouched by all and we were not in the mood to comment - mea culpa. Only one had a desert which was standard apple crumble with custard - as advertised - nothing ""special"" i.e. little if any cinnamon etc. Apple, sugar and custard - there you have it. A small but targeted wine list largely consisting of French wines and some New World. Waiter was friendly, efficient and disinterested in our dining experience. Overall - sort of food we would expect for Sunday Lunch in a reasonable pub (with the exception of the venison which was well below standard). Dining for four people, one bottle of pleasant wine - approx 210 pounds.",2.0

This was easily the best Italian food in Notting Hill. We shard a wood-fired pizza, along with the house white wine which was excellent. We then shared a grilled wild sea bass. The waiter was extremely friendly and helpful, helping us to select our fish and reassuring us that the fish was indeed wild and that every trawler was tagged so that they knew which boat had caught every fish. We ordered some roast potatoes to accompany the fish, which was perfect. The lemon and olive oil sauce on the fish was quite delicious.

7829,Maggie Jones's,367447456,April 2016,"Came here after a friend recomendation and, intrigued by the pictures on the website we had to try it. Maggie Jones is only 5 min away from Fashionable High street Kensington and Notting Hill but when you enter you travel in space and time to a quaint countryside taver from 1900. Environment is surreal and we had fun litterary looking around us while we were waiting for the food. We were a large group of 10 so we we had to take the set menu for 3 courses each. I wanted to trust Maggie so I opted for Maggie's tart of the day as a starter and Maggie's fish pie as a main. The tart, spinach, cheese, eggs and onion was very good and also a very good portion as a starter. The Fish Pie was againa very big portion and expecially the mashed potato was extremely delicious. All the mains came with lots of veggies on the side included in the prices. Big portions plus extra veggies meant that we all really struggled to finish the food on the table. As a dessert I went for the cream Brule'. Nice crunchy texturized top and creamy underneath. According to my girlfriend the Lemon sorbet wasn't the best she ever had in terms of flavour but still very enjoyable.",5.0

This is our go to restaurant when we have guests visiting from out of town. Food is your basic standard British menu- but the quality is excellent. My favorite is the lamb with garlic and rosemary. My husband is a big fan of the pies- especially the seafood pie. (Note that at dinner, everything is a la carte so you have to order veggies on the side- I've found that 2-3 sides can easily feed 3 to 4 people). The atmosphere is fun as well. It is a bit cramped at times, but it's rustic and charming and always a nice time. Price is a little high, especially at dinner, but you pay for what you get and I'd very happily pay more here than at a standard pub to guarantee an excellent meal.",5.0

I think he did not have a good command of English. The food is very overpriced and our meals were simply not worth the price...and they charge a 1 pound cover charge just to eat there!

At first they could not find it as moved down and hidden by another kiosk, had the mighty cup closed he thought? The answer is no, and so much the better. The tortellini were as good as before and eyes closed with a cream and mushroom sauce as good as had been had in Italy, refined cooking this is not, but in terms of simple Italian food this is very good. The small round breads opened and stuffed with hams were delicious also. If any complaint could be raised it might be that the gnocchi were perhaps a touch over cooked though the sauce was perfectly acceptable and perhaps this could be also the way they were made. But all in all a happy little meal and certainly worth trying. Cost is a little steep for a kiosk but then again in keeping with the area so perhaps not the fault of the shop. a happy experience all round and our party were very pleased and some went back to order more before we left.",4.0

My husband had a steak when we went last week, the meal was quite small and certainly not value for money. I had cauliflower cheese with my salmon and it really was quite bland and the sauce tasted more of flour than it did cheese.

8081,Maggie Jones's,287857221,July 2015,"In 1977 the wedding party for my first wedding was held at Maggie Jones's - which had been my favourite restaurant for years. It still is. Some things have changed - the basement was once a romantic room with a five or six private little booths, now additional tables have been added (some years ago now) which make it crowded, atmospheric and loud. The first floor has changed from storeroom, through bar area to additional restaurant space. Some things haven't changed - the Gent's (!!!), the chicken and artichoke pie, the house wine - comes in a large bottle, drink as much as you like and the bottle is measured to calculate the bill. I find that this becomes a challenge and a target - but that could just be me. Early Friday evening, booth in the basement, excellent service from Mark. A full three courses with wine and tip - £122.18. Venison Terrine (£7.50) - first class, potted shrimps (£9.00) - good. Chicken & Artichoke pie - first class (for a light meal I would think about sharing this between two), Rump steak (£19.25) - not a success, undercooked and some gristle. Sides - cauliflower cheese (£6) and peas and bacon (4.25) - good and lots of it. Desserts - ice cream and bread & butter pudding. Both good. House white - perfectly drinkable. So - the food is comfort food, nothing too clever, not 'fine dining' but all the better for that. Remove a couple of tables from the basement and it would be pretty much my ideal.",5.0

I've had a lot of quality pasta in my time and this is top tier. Portion sizes for prices were on point too. The thing that makes this place the best though is the staff, both workers were extremely friendly, funny and made you feel welcome! When we asked for a Corona they said they had only recently taken it off the menu, so the owner (I presume) said he'd take care of it and went off somewhere for a couple minutes then came back with 2 ice cold coronas.

The staff are very friendly and efficient, and went out of their way to be accommodating.The only very slight drawback is that the wine is a tad expensive, the cheapest red starting at 26.00 but having said that it was a lovely bottle of wine, so more a case of quality over quantity, we sipped slow and savoured.We will be returning again, very soon.",5.0

It's the kind of place you would want to bring a visitor to London, especially a first time one, as it is like stepping back in time to a Dickensian London. This is especially true of the upstairs room. The lighting is low, and the room a bit higgidy piggidy with lots of high backed wooden church pews which turn each of the scrubbed tables into their own private dining area. Loads of brick-a-brac hang from the walls and the ceiling. It could feel theme-y, but somehow it doesn't. The food is old British favourites, savoury pies, steak, liver and onions and the like. Everything comes al la carte and one then orders sides to accompany the main. My husband and I both had the chicken and artichoke pie with sides of cauliflower cheese and spinach. The food was all delightful and, to top it all off, so was the excellent service.

My mum found her liver was frozen in the middle and had to send it back. The mash was processed (Smash add water) The peas were out of a tin. The fish pie was dry and looked very unappetising. The waiters were so cocky it was just rude. And the price tag was unbelievably high considering everything felt like it had come from Iceland Supermarket or been made in advance in the Boar War and defrosted almost like a scientific experiment.

Four of us, however, enjoyed a very pleasant dinner. The atmosphere is similar at the the two restaurants but the menu is subtlely different and more English than French. We started with avocado crab or stilton, bacon & walnut salad; then we had guinea fowl (huge portions) or steak and kidney pie. For pudding we had bread & butter pudding or mango & orange jelly. The total bill with wine and coffees was £222 including service.

So I went on Google Maps and used the Street View to pinpoint the restaurant. Anyway, my wife (who has an uncanny ability to pick a great restaurant at random -- after 40+ years, I've learned not to question) and I were walking in the early evening and noticed Maggie Jones across the street. She walked over, read the menu, and agreed with me to walk around and look for other options. After about 10 minutes, she said ""forget it, we are going back."" We walked in to a very full restauarant, without a reservation, but were offered a small table on the main floor under the stairs. It turned out to be the best seat in the house. We were in the middle of everything, very well attended to with great humor, and the food was exceptional -- I had a lamb dish -- and we have talked about our experience many times (often in the context of my bowing to my wife's superior culinary instincts).

I asked to be moved and as we went to another side of the restaurant I realised the whole place was filthy. There was screwed up toilet tissue in the floor at the exit to the toilet. If this is what customers can see it begs the question what can't we see, what goes on in the kitchen and how hygienic is the food preparation. Needless to say we didn't stay.",1.0

8246,Maggie Jones's,241733642,November 2014,"Had dinner at this restuarant just recently. The ambiance is very atmospheric and cosy, lit only by candles.. the service slightly overconfident and uninterested and the menu pretty limited with mains starting at £15. I ordered the wild boar sausages which were nicely cooked and juicy and served on a bed of decent mash. And that was all. No gravy. No onions. And certainly no sides. Extremely disappointing. Their motto is most certainly Not ""go the extra mile"" and ambiance alone does not make for a great meal out. Charged too for a measly bit of bread and some tired crudite, and given the cost of the meal I felt this was a rip off.. The house wine was good. Would I go back. No.",3.0

Pork crackle was supplied along with steamed new potatoes, steamed carrot slices and green peas with bacon. The serve of vegetables was very generous as well. This was a hearty and delicious meal. My only quibble is that the peas were overcooked. I ordered a glass of red wine but was told I'd be given a magnum of wine and would be charged only for what I drank. The wine was a very pleasant Cotes de Rhone. The meal including service came to just over 13 pounds - an absolute steal. The service was friendly and prompt. I like the scrubbed pine tables but the multiple farm type objects on the walls and ceiling are cluttered and overdone for me. In my opinion, the decor needs streamlining.

8290,Maggie Jones's,236752892,October 2014,"I can happily say with confidence that I have found my new favorite restaurant in London. On many previous trips/layovers in London I had peered through the dark outside widows and saw what appeared to be a very cozy atmosphere where diners were dining by beautiful warm candlelight. So, one of my good friends and renowned “foodie” and I decided to try Maggie Jones’s. From the moment we entered the restaurant where we were promptly and warmly greeted by Patrice and Christine, I knew we were in for a treat! If you are like me, and love authentically rustic décor with dark stained hardwoods and candles glowing on every table, you too will fall in love with this amazing gem of a restaurant. The lovely jazz music from the 30s to the 50s adds to this unbelievable establishment’s ambiance just as the hanging baskets with dried flowers do. Now, let’s talk FOOD! The menu is simple, elegant and wholesome, yet, unique with interesting specials displayed on a movable chalk board that the servers bring to each booth or table. I have had the pleasure of being served by Oliver twice now and he is both personable and professional. The timing of the food delivery and presentation was spot on! I thoroughly enjoyed one of the freshly prepared salads as a starter and then, “as the Brits say”, tucked in to a perfectly seasoned and deliciously cooked rump steak of lamb. The side dish of their baked cauliflower & cheese served in a mini iron skillet was delectable! If you choose to dine on the lower level, you can watch the amazing Portuguese chefs, Grace and Martin create their magic on a plate that I’m told they’ve been doing here for nearly 40 years. After an amazing dinner, we were given a full tour of the 3 level rustic wonderland known as Maggie Jones’s along with some fun history about the former “home” now restaurant. The prices are neither inexpensive nor overpriced especially in London near Kensington! But I find the value more than fair for what I will call my favorite dining experience in 8 years of laying over in London on a weekly basis. Yes, I’m an international flight attendant who has had the good fortune of experiencing some amazing meals, especially in Paris and many other cities in Europe and South America. I have to say, Maggie Jones’s is now at the top of my list!",5.0

I sadly haven't been back there since, so was apprehensive about trying it again after so long. But it still looked the same from outside so we decided to give it a go. What we found was the same friendly, intimate and cosy place it always was. And I was delighted to discover that it has the same owner and the same chef as before, and more or less the same type of menu! The waiting staff were fun and friendly - a special mention to our waiter 'Max', who made us feel at home and looked after us perfectly. The food was excellent, as it always was before - I had sirloin steak with pepper sauce which was very tasty and perfectly cooked to my taste and my partner had the recommended rack of lamb, which was delicious! We ordered 3 veg side dishes, and were told by our waiter that this was plenty - in fact more than enough (he actually suggested we drop one) but we really wanted to try the 3 we ordered. Whilst not cheap the side dishes are more than generous and are very good. My only criticism would be that the sherry trifle was a little dry (too much sponge perhaps?) but still very nice. We quaffed the house wine, served from a magnum and you only pay for what you drink which is still a great system. Whilst the house red wouldn't win any awards it was pleasant and drinkable enough. Price wise it's not the cheapest place, but for a restaurant in the heart of Kensington we felt it was very affordable and a lovely birthday treat. I'm looking forward to going back and will NOT wait 20 years! It remains a fantastic place to come as a couple as many of the tables are very intimate and private.",5.0
8326,Maggie Jones's,222527564,August 2014,"Wife and I each enjoyed our pies, her the root vegetable and me the fish. Also enjoyed our appetizers. Host and waiter both fantastic, helped with the menu, just the right amount of chatting and and kept our 15 month old amused and entertained. Atmosphere pretty much as described by other readers - cozy, comfortable, relaxing. While it wasn't cheap, we were realistic about where we were and for that, the prices were acceptable.",5.0

Returning from a day of sightseeing in a drizzly afternoon, we ducked in, hoping to find a table despite not having a reservation. Fortunately for us, there was a table for two in a warm little corner by a window. Service was very good, atmosphere cozy and intimate, food excellent. I would have been happy to have a second serving of the Stilton soufflé appetizer as an entrée, and my companion loved the venison. We also found the name amusing. Apparently, this was Princess Margaret's pseudonym when she made reservations incognito. A great choice.",4.0
8329,Maggie Jones's,226794042,October 2013,"Great little local restaurant tucked away in Kensington. Recommended to us by a local, and it didnt disappoint. The range on the menu was great, as was the selection of wine & beverages. It wasnt a cheap place, but that is understandable for the location. Having said that, 6 of us got out of there for under $800, and let me tell you, we drank everything from beer, wine, champagne, & cocktails, as well as a 3 course meal each & coffee. Im pretty sure they were glad to see the back of us by the end of the night. The place was packed, but it was a very civilised crowd & environment.

To be fair, the staff were lovely, but the food was a bit of a shocker. I chose the salmon, thinking it would be a fillet, but it turned out to be a rather bony steak. Finding the bones - lots of them - really put me off, and I could not finish the dish. My overall impression was of a restaurant caught in a time warp, and not in a good way. The kitchen needs a wake up call and the menu needs a revamp. Maggie Jones is in a great location, tucked away just off Kensington High Street, but it is not capitalising on its advantages.",2.0

So we went back and 10 minutes later were seated. This kind of service alone was brilliant. But wait for it - our server was twice as good. His service was efficient, patient (for we did take our time in deciding what to eat - everything on the menu looked great) and he started talking to us as well while serving - not the usual ""here's your food, enjoy.."" but real conversation, which was very nice. And the food - amazing. I ordered lamb medium specifically asking for no blood and it came out perfect. And delicious. This dish is a must try.

Lighting is dim, but not too much so, and appropriate artifacts adorn surfaces and ceilings. The total effect is cosy, romantic and interesting. And the food is terrific. This time we had beef and mango and a steak and kidney pie. The portions are substantial and there was much lip-smacking and ums and ahs of contentment. The service was efficient and friendly.

We were shown our table and quickly asked for our drinks order. We noticed that they now bring you a refillable soft drink rather than just providing you with a glass. The salad bar was quite adequately filled at the time of our visit. This has previously been a bit of a problem on previous visits. Service was quite good for a Saturday evening with the restaurant being rather full. One thing that always 'grates' is the noise of the chairs moving on the flooring. This is the only Harvester where we notice that this happens. It is grating and rather high pitched. You loose all track of conversation whilst this happens.

It's been an absolute age since I have been to one and I very much doubt I would go again. We did not book and had a little wait no problems there. My wife had to take the kids to the toilet during this wait and the toilets were an absolute state to the point they had to wait for the disabled one to free up. I ordered a few drinks from the bar all good so far. Then our little gadget buzzed to say the table is ready. We were shown to the table was given a little explanation on how things work, salad bar, sauces, etc... all good so far... not long after an old deer came over and took our order. We went for the salad bar and drinks finished... waited, waited, waited... no one came to ask if we wanted more drinks and the food took ages to come out. When the food did finally come my kids were full on the rabbit food and no one even asked how our meal was (it was ok and nothing special) so we then moved on to the desert as it was part of the kids meal ... did anyone take our empty plates ... no... the old deer was run off her feet... took ages to take a payment also to the point we almost walked out... another bug also they put stuff on the kids menu that is not even part of the kids meal deals something we had to question... but things went a little worse as we had a view of the doors to the kitchen and it was left open ...

On this trip I was determined so we got directions and an address from our hotel. Even with the approximate location marked on a map and the address, we circled the neighborhood several times before finding it. The secret is to look for it in an alley about three doors from Kensington Church Street (first right after the junction of Kensington High Street and Ken Church).

Additionally, it was not just our waiter, but everyone we encountered or who assisted us. Our waiter, Oscar, was perfect. He gave us great advice, listened to our wishes and assured us that we had made great decisions. Wow, he was right. Everything on the menu was tempting, but our selections were wonderful.

We went last night and stood at the front for about ten minutes before someone even acknowledged our existence (not a good start!). We were told that there would be a 30 min wait for a table. We didn't mind this, as we had been on previous occasions and told there would be a 30 min wait which ended up being much less. However, on this occasion, we waited 45 minutes for the table. In the meantime we ordered drinks at the bar (which took about 20 mins). The guy behind the bar was doing his best but nobody stepped in to help him, despite there being 2-3 other members of staff standing around in the vicinity. We were eventually shown to a table and were surprised to see that the restaurant was almost empty, which certainly didn't explain why we'd waited so long to be seated! It then took another ten minutes for a waitress to come over and take our orders. By this time we'd been in the place for over an hour and were still no closer to eating! Once our orders had been taken we made our way to the salad bar, which was under-stocked and the bowls were absolutely filthy - the people behind us also commented on this. This was the final straw. My husband spoke to a team leader and asked him to cancel our order (after explaining all the aforementioned issues). We could have lived with it if it was a one-off experience but we've had bad experiences in here before. We have kept coming back because we've also had good experiences. But the place is desperately under-staffed and the attitude of some of the staff is terrible! We certainly won't be going back in a hurry, at least not to this one.",1.0

8478,Maggie Jones's,188247822,December 2013,"My boyfriend and I treated each other to a meal at maggie jones for our christmas celebration together. Unfortunately other than the company the evening was really awful. We couldn't have been more disappointed to be honest after having such high hopes. We had the duck liver pâté and chicken and avocado salad ( approx £8 each) for our respective starters, the presentation was slap dash and everything tasted very 'shop bought' and unexciting. This disappointment was followed by the rump of lamb and shoulder of pork for our main courses (£16.50-19.50 each) . These also required you to order sides which only add more bland flavour and expense. All the food was fatty, greasy and tasteless. The service was equally bad with a complete lack on interest, attention or apology ( once mentioned that the food was way below expectation) from all staff. The place and decor is the only thing charming and romantic about this place. This is one of the worst places I have eaten in- If you want a good meal out do not eat here.",1.0
8479,The George Harvester,377294919,May 2016,"We had pre-booked for Sunday lunchtime but it was not particularly busy on arrival. However, the restaurant soon started filling up more around 1.30pm, particulary with families with young children. Credit must be given to Allison, our waitress, who flitted from table to table and bar to kitchen throughout our whole time there but still remained fully attentive to our needs. The service was excellent. The tables and menus were clean. A bug bear of mine is sticky tables and menus. The salad bar was clean and rigorously replenished. The condiment areas were also very clean. The menu is often changed but felt that currently there were too many variations on the same theme, ie. lots of chicken, burgers or steak in various ways. There used to be more variety and, although not a pure vegetarian, I often choose a vegetarian main, but noticed that there was now a vcry limited choice. Presumably, to avoid shoppers using the car park, you now have to pay but it is only £1 for a 2 hour stay and the money is refundable when settling your bill. Overall, a good experience but would be deterred from visiting too frequently due to limitations of the new menu.",4.0

8496,Maggie Jones's,184174783,November 2013,"We visited Maggie Jones's twice during our recent week's stay in Kensington, and were delighted both times. Lunch upstairs, on a cool and rainy Tuesday, was terrific -- I had a roasted chicken quarter, mashed potatoes, and veg, and we washed it all down with a nice bottle of rose. The highly eclectic interior gives hints of Dickens's London, an old farmhouse, and more... our tabletop, at lunch, seemed to have been made out of old window shutters (completely cleaned up, of course -- a nice antique effect). All in all, a fine lunch -- enjoyable enough that we returned for dinner on a cold and rainy Friday evening. That night we sat at a two-top in a small space at the base of the stairway going up and at the top of the stairway going downstairs, but the traffic was in no way disruptive -- in fact the location gave us a lot of opportunities to chat up and joke around with the young, interesting, and international staff. Dinner was wonderful -- my main dish was venison, done to perfection. Too often, I find, restaurants turn out venison that is dry and thus rather tough; this dish, however, was done with West Riding Sauce (a red wine-based traditional Yorkshire offering) and was tender and delicious. It was one of our best nights out in a very long time, really a magical evening in many ways -- dinner was well-presented and came at an agreeable price. Maggie's will be at the top of our list when and if we are back in London. They don't offer espresso, but there is a Cafe Rouge maybe ten steps away where we fed out (OK, my...) coffee habit quite well --",5.0

We were warmly greeted and escorted upstairs to a lovely corner candle-lit table. In spite of all the nearby tables being occupied, it did not feel crowded or annoyingly loud. The menu is varied and there are several nightly specials. The prices are on the moderate side for the posh Kensington address. The wine list is not particularly large, but offers good choices from many regions. The staff is friendly and efficient and very willing to answer any menu queries. Our food was delivered promptly. Our appetizers of shrimp cocktail and crab ""parcel"" were both lovely in taste and presentation. And, our entrees of liver/bacon and steak/kidney pie were very soothing and filling.

The whole atmosphere and, indeed, the menu has changed little over the years. This is good, warming, English food - great for a cold wet night like last night - in a cosy room decked out with numerous historic pieces of paraphernalia. (There are actually three floors altogether.) The £40 New Year's Eve menu was excellent value and offered lots of choice (including vegetarian options). We both started with soup - my onion soup was excellent and my husband enjoyed his mushroom soup. We then both had the medallions of venison which came well done as we had requested. The portions here are very substantial but, being greedy, we both found room for desserts - the stilton for him and very delicious Christmas pudding ice cream for me.

After reading this review I actually tried to dissuade my daughter from going there, but as it was a bit late in the day also her birthday treat and she likes something a bit different than the usual run of the mill places, thought what the hell and we went anyway. My husband had the Christmas dinner, me the lamb and my daughter the fish pie. We all liked our meals but the old man thought the sprouts were a little hard, I thought they were ok though, although thought sprouts with lamb was a bit strange but that maybe just me being picky.

I've had other mains like steak and fish and they were good too. And, so were the chips.",5.0

I had rack of lamb that was so superb I almost photographed it so i could savour it again and again. The second time was for traditional Sunday lunch with my husband. Even though the reservations was messed up, they bent over backwards to make sure we got a table and an excellent lunch - they also gave us each a glass of wine on the house for the inconvenience. It's a fun and homey interior with lovely staff and delicious food. I'm going to make sure I go there when I'm in London in October.",5.0

The staff seemed tense; some guests at another table overstayed their welcome... or so it felt. The servers rushed to prepare tables, yet were very slow in serving customers. I'd go back, just to see if it was just an odd night...",3.0
8554,Maggie Jones's,160524653,May 2013,Came here on the recommendation of friend who loves the place. Expectation was that we were in for a treat after swing the rustic decor upon walking into the place. The expensive a la carte menu also suggested that we would be in for something special.,3.0
8555,The George Harvester,343762200,January 2016,"Went on Friday night at 5pm. We were told there would be a 20-30 minute wait, but the restaurant was only 1/3 full as it's quite open plan. We waited 30 minutes and in that time, six sets of dinners came and left stating that they didn't want to wait. It that many leave in 30 minutes, imagine how many leave in over the evening, so much lost revenue. The staff were very friendly, ordered our meal and where then told 5 minutes later that they had run out of the pulled pork burger and had to order something else. Food was reasonable. When it came to paying the bill, the card machine would not work. We waited about 10 minutes and where then told that the all the harvester branches machines were broken.. The only option was to pay cash, so we had to walk to a cash point machine round the corner to facilitate this. We got some money off the bill. Wouldn't hurry back.",3.0
8556,Maggie Jones's,161366080,May 2013,The concept is a good idea - a very cosy place with rustic decor. Service very attentive and friendly. Good house wine. However I cannot say I was impressed at all by the food. My crab salad starter wasn't any better than the ready to buy thing from a supermarket. The main - liver with bacon and onions - was not seasoned at all and the bacon was tough as a shoe sole. Despite of the positives I listed above I won't be going back for that food.,3.0

All sauces mixed up at the counter so it took 3 goes to find one we thought we might like (it was also horrid) The little silver dishes were wet and stuck together (lovely). Flavours were all horrible. We did not know we could still get our favourite kickin chicken until after the meal either. Ribs were tasteless (unusual) and chicken dry (also unusual). It was not broke so why on earth did they try to fix it. Not going back until they improve the menu bring back reasonable earlybird prices and forget those horrible new sauces!",1.0

We are shown to our table and it is filthy Our waitress seems to be flying around all over the place and waiting on too many tables and customers, she apologises time and again but nothing improves. I, along with another member of our party, get a meal that is different to what we ordered, when we pointed this out to the waitress she replied, "" did you really want the other stuff that's missing?"" well, what we did get was a dried out piece of beef with no sauce or pineapple, some bland sweet potato chips and cold beans in a cup/mug! No cutlery on the table or elsewhere and we had to ask 3 different people to get us some. Nothing to wash our hands/fingers in after eating the starters either. This place is in dire need of a visit from a certain department and management needs to be changed ASAP! A warning about eating there at night, the lights are switched off in the carpark and apart from it being a health & safety issue this also stops customers from seeing the few signs that state you have to pay to use the carpark!! We were asked if we had bought a ticket at the end of our meal, some 2 hours after we arrived! We should have been told about the parking fines when we arrived...not at the end! All in all, poor food, poor hygene, this place is a greasy spoon cafe that is in need of an upgrade and an inspection. There is no way I/we will be returning because it is obvious that genuine customer feedback is not at all important to the staff & management of this establishment and I would wager that any comments/suggestions are discarded out of hand.",1.0

The food was also very good. Excellent rack of lamb and steak and kidney pie, but the third member of our party was disappointed with the guinea fowl. HOWEVER: the restaurant charges a cover charge per person AND puts a 12.5 % service charge on the bill. Says it's optional, but the waiter didn't know what to do when we asked to change it. This is Europe, not the US. A tip of 10 % is normal since staff are paid a reasonable salary. We wanted to deduct the meaningless service charge, the manager agreed to that.",4.0

8623,Maggie Jones's,146535689,November 2012,"I have eaten at Maggie Jones's - fondly named after the late Princess Margaret due to its close proximity to Kensington Palace - since the 80s. Whilst the menu has changed in that time, the quality of the food has not. I still recall the no longer available steak and mango casserole of the 90s! Whilst Maggie's is an all year round eatery serving superbly wholesome food, she really comes to life on bitter winter evenings with her nooks and crannies table settings based on a small coaching house in style. One bit of advice - avoid a table too close to the front door if booking in winter! Wooden benches in which to huddle, more open table and chair settings for the not so romantic or the large upstairs long table setting for 20 or so for that noisy birthday group or festive get togethers. 'Maggie' is very accommodating if rather noisy - bit like her namesake! The food is consistently good - individual freshly made pies are a particular speciality – melt in the moth calves liver, steaks, fish pie, a really warming menu in every respect. House wine is by the inch! – or should that be the centimetre now? – served in large two-hander bottles then measured at the end of the meal to determine how much – or how many! – you have drunk! Book for a late tables – this is not a pre-theatre venue although it is within staggering distance of the Royal Albert Hall. This is a venue for a cosy, catch up the gossip meal or a family dinner for a special occasion. The bill is not cheap but then neither is the food, wine or the ambience.

8624,Maggie Jones's,147480837,October 2012,"We drove down from Manchester yesterday, and we were told to try Maggie Jones by a friend of ours, and whilst it was a 5 minute walk from our hotel it seemed like a good idea. The actual resteraunt is quite shabby but in a nice way. The waiters were all friendly and very helpful. I had the pate for starters and my partner had the advocado and crab. His was lovely and fresh. The pate didn't really taste of anything although it was palatable. Main was sirloin steak and chips with pepper sauce. Never again. The steak was very thin but it was cooked as ordered, rare and to perfection however, the taste was terrible. It tasted like it had been cooked on a griddle that hadn't been cleaned in months. Can't really find the words to describe it really. Then the chips.Again, looked OK but they tasted like they had been cooked in 'old' oil. Horrid, horrid, horrid. I did tell the waiter it wasn't good and he sent a lady over which I presumed was the manager or owner. She asked me what was wrong, I told her and then asked me what I wanted to do. No apologies, nothing. I think this restaurant has a great menu on paper but awful menu on the plate.",2.0

The table was booked for us after my daughter did research of the area, we needed somewhere nice too eat after a visit to the Royal Albert Hall. The staff were all very good and the atmosphere friendly and cosy. The duck pate was out of this world and the prawns in the prawn cocktail were perfect not soft and soggy like some places. The rump steak was done to perfection, I usually have rib-eye but it was not on the menu. The steak was soooo tasty. My partner had stuffed roast shoulder of pork with apple, again so tasty and a good size piece of meat. The vegetables were extra as were the potatoes or chips.The bread & butter pudding for afters was one of the best we had tasted. A little on the expensive side but again no complaints with taste and size of portions. All came out piping hot which to us is very important.

Started with the crab & avocado salad served on a bed of arugula (rocket) and then moved on to roasted rump of lamb with rosemary and garlic. It was served medium-rare under a crisp layer of fat. The roasted grouse (""game of the day"") was excellent - the skin was crisp and golden and the meat was juicy and tender. Underneath the generous portion was the liver, served over toast. Both the accompanying gravy and bread sauce were delicious. The sides (spinach & french green beans), ordered separately were perfectly cooked. Ended the meal with a refreshing lemon gelato.

We ordered the cauliflour cheese to see whether it was worth £6 as a side dish, I still can't see the justification in that when it came. My mum's is better. When you pay £100 for 2 courses and a bottle of wine though you expect some good service. When we arrived we weren't greeted but told we would be seated soon, no how are you, smiles etc. No one said goodbye either. In terms of the meal, unfortuantely we felt like the KP was serving us, food plonked down and not even asked who was having what. The service just felt very cold and a real shame.

8646,Maggie Jones's,145821763,November 2012,"We would dearly love to give this restaurant an Excellent rating, because the food deserves it. . We have eaten here a number of times over the years, and it has never failed once on its food. The one thing that prevents us from giving an Excellent is the issue of wine. The list is good, well-varied and of reasonable quality, but the apparent sheer greed in the mark-up for wines is astounding. A nice bottle of wine here is around £26-£29. And on top of that the management charges a further 12.5% service charge on the bill. So a decent bottle of Beaujolais, for example, ends up costing well over £30. This is a real shame, because in all other respects Maggie Jones is excellent. The food is loosely based on traditional British – largely English – cooking, with superb pies, game, stews, soups, and puddings. It constantly gets good reviews, and deservedly so. We have found the service to be OK and helpful - no issues here.",4.0

I have eaten here a few times and I always leave disappointed, there is a beefeater in walking distance from here and while it may be more expensive it really is worth it.

8664,Maggie Jones's,139826968,September 2012,"We wanted a traditional Sunday lunch for our first full day in London on holiday, and Maggie Jones did not let us down. They offer a 3 course table d'hôte for 20 pounds (plus gratuity added by the restaurant), with a choice of roast beef, lamb, pork or chicken. Our waiter talked my husband out of ordering the chicken (which he said was a bit bland - but then, he wasn't a Brit) in in favour of the beef and Yorkshire pud, while I opted for the lamb. Portions were reasonably large, and came rare, as ordered. Roast onion and potato were done nicely, too. Haddock mousse and Stilton mousse were our appetizers, and were full of the flavour of the fish and the cheese. If we have a complaint, it is probably that the traditional veggies, cabbage and sliced carrots, were terribly ordinary and reminiscent of English food in its not so halcyon days 40 years ago. Due to the size of meal, we skipped the bread and butter pudding in favour of lemon sorbet (nicely tart).",5.0

8666,Maggie Jones's,138705850,June 2012,"From the scrubbed wooden tables and the mis-matched chairs, to the secret little nooks and the creaky stairs, it's as if you are sitting in an eccentric English farmhouse. They jam you all in somehow, and it's all part of the atmosphere, if you like the sardine-tin experience. Personally, I don't, but just occasionally I get a hankering for classic English dishes like rack of lamb, steak and kidney pie and fish pie, and although the prices seem to be on the steep side (£24, £17.50 and £17.50 respectively), the portions are generous-to-bloating. It's good old fashioned comfort food served by enthusiastic staff. If I ate there regularly, my waistline wouldn't let me slip into one of those romantic little booths any more.

8670,Maggie Jones's,141224966,September 2012,"We chose Maggie Jones's for our last dinner in London at the end of our two-week London holiday. The restaurant itself is charming. I would suggest making reservations. We came on a Thursday evening and the place was packed. The staff was able to offer us a table upstairs, but told us that we would need to vacate it by 8:15 pm as it had been reserved by someone else for that time. That worked fine and gave us plenty of time for a leisurely meal. The place is crammed with all sorts of interesting decor and it was hard to take it all in with the candlelight. The effect was romantic and fun all at the same time. We were waited on by several different staff members during our meal (this was a common theme in London) but it was fine. My husband ordered the roast lamb and he said it was the best meat he had eaten during our trip - very flavorful and delicious. I ordered the root vegetable pot pie. It was good, but nothing extraordinary. It definitely needed a little more color - fortunately it tasted better than it looked. The waiter did advise us that there would be plenty to share. This was helpful. My husband shared the vegetables and did not have to order his own side. I ordered an artichoke starter. It was huge and the dip accompanying it was very delicious. My husband started with the shrimp pot and he enjoyed that too. We were intrigued by the ""mango, passion fruit and orange jelly"" dessert. We asked the waiter about it and he was surprised we did not know what it was. We explained that it was not something we normally see on an American menu. It's basically a fancy jello salad packed with fruit. We both ordered it and liked it very much! It was a cool and refreshing end to a rather heavy British meal. We did laugh, though, that we went all the way to London to eat jello salad for dessert. Overall, I would rather this as a good meal in London, but not one of my favorites. It's just a personal preference, though, as this is not my favorite type of cuisine. Like I said earlier, my husband said the roast lamb was exceptional.

Eating tepid boiled potatoes and beans is not my idea of a meal so I waited for the salmon to be returned, by which time the potatoes and beans were stone cold.

Well, I wasn't sure whether to believe it after reading Rick Steves and TripAdvisor reviews, but it is not a mirage. The food is a mix of English fare (meat or veggie pies, for example), grilled meats and fish, tarts, and a chalkboard of specials. My wife said the lamb pie was the best she'd ever had; the veggie dish was very good as well.

Simple menu with daily specials, this focuses on British classics well made with good ingredients in ample servings. A potted shrimp starter followed by a fish pie was more than enough to eat and, for good ingredients, a bargain at less than $25 within shouting distance of Kensington Palace.

We were surprised to find that the restaurant inside was nog as busy and we were seated almost immediately. We were first given a table fifteen feet inside the restaurant opposite the front doors. This proved to be a very cold spot as the door was continually opened and closed causing a very cold draught. We asked to move and were given a table in the side area beside the doors to the garden. This was not draughty but still very cold as there appeared to be no heating . We ordered our food and drinks and helped ourselves to salad. It was still very cold but we noticed an electric heater plugged in beside us we eventually got the go ahead from a young female staff member to turn it on. This did take the chill off slightly. We then waited for our meals to arrive and noticed that the area appeared to be very dirty with food waste under tables and the striped floor carpet dirty and patchy. There was also a number of tables with dirty plates and glasses left on them, these tables remained dirty for over twenty minutes and until we left.

The food is traditional pub fare and the atmosphere is very romantic and appealing. I highly recommend the chicken and artichoke pie, the fish pie, the baked cauliflower with cheese and the beef and mango stew. Prices seem reasonable, too. Make sure you book a table.",5.0
8772,Maggie Jones's,119529510,October 2011,"The food is unimaginative and the cooking basic; the 'ambient' lighting would be a little dark for a 19th Century coalmine. Seating is cramped and totally unsuited for groups. Mainly bistro/cafe food, but at grossly inflated prices - plus vegetables/potatoes are extra as are a service and cover charge. House white wine, served in magnum, is very poor. They've missed a trick by not hiring out torches so you can read the menu; but then you'd notice the prices!",2.0
8773,The George Harvester,234039914,October 2014,I visit this restaurant almost once a month with a group of friends. We don't expect much it's a cheap and cheerful menu/restaurant so al la carte it isn't BUT this time I was forced to complain to staff and the manager. First table we were given had chips and salad pieces on the carpet and the smell was vile. I asked to move. Second table......next to over flowing bin. Staff idea of cleaning a table is to wipe bits onto the floor. Handle of sauces covered in sauce. female toilets.....I don't have the stomach to describe! Last month a staff member dropped Tartar sauce onto the floor and failed to tell 2 of us that it had gone onto their clothing!! This branch has just had a new re-fit-what a waste. We would normally stay for drinks after are meal but we went to the restaurant across the road. I will be surprised if I go back next month as I can still smell the stench from the carpet.,1.0

There were empty tables everywhere with dirty glasses, plates & food that were still not cleared an hour & a half later when we left! I ordered a 'gourmet' burger, what a joke! It was certainly in no way 'GOURMET'. It was a cheap frozen iceland job with 1 piece of lettuce & a tiny dollop of burger sauce. it came with chips which I didn't ask for & they were cold! Everyone elses chips were cold as well & the peas were almost frozen! One of our party had the steak & it was rare instead of medium. I defo would not even bother coming here again if they paid me.

The main problem with this restaurant is that you cannot pre-book and we find it difficult to get in as it gets so busy. Mid week is easiest. Also a great place for lunch or coffee and dessert as it less busy during the day.,3.0

The staff are very helpful, albeit a bit on the quick side to try and take your order. We helped ourselves from the well stocked salad bar and both of us chose Triple Chicken as our main course.

On our way back from Venice they closed JFK airport due to a blizzard and we couldn't get another flight out for 4 days. A friend took us to Maggie Jones for dinner (she had been going there for years) and we were very impressed. The atmosphere was charming (lit by candles in wine bottles-I don't know how the place hasn't had a fire) and the food was wonderful. In fact we went back a couple of days later. It's decor is reminicent of a French country inn of the 1940's and the background music reinforces that theme with great old standards from the '40's. We had a fabulous warm arugula and porcini mushroom salad with parmesean slices ($15) and split a crabmeat dish (smoked salmon wrapped around the crabmeat. - they offered it as an appetizer or a main (2 pieces for $27). We often eat in NYC restaurants and found the prices about the same as the city. The only thing we felt wasn't that good was the trifle dessert. A very romantic restaurant.,4.0

8815,TortelliniCup,316877369,October 2015,"After having lived in Modena, which is in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, I developed a slight dependence on a local cuisine called 'Gnoccho e Tigelle.' These are not the gnocchi that most people are acquainted with, but are a regional type of dough, similar to pizza dough, that is folded several times and fried. In Modena they are fried in lard, but TortelliniCup have opted for a much healthier option with no pork. The gnoccho can be severed with prosciutto, mortadella, salami or even as a sweet with nutella! They also make other fantastic regional Emiliano delights like Parmigiana and la gramigna as well as lasagna and other wonderful Italian foods.

There is just room for about six stools along one side and two along another. There are blackboards advertising three or four different pastas and sauces as well as a special of the day which looked like a vegetarian version of one of the foregoing. A rather irritating fellow diner interrupted my order of gramigna, small coils of pasta, with sausage and ham, failing to understand the sausage and ham was niot in the pasta itself but in a sauce to go on top. He insisted on a different pasta with a bolognese sauce. Both were cooked in front of us by a young Italian chef who confirmed the boss (who presumably owns several of these franchises) was at a sushi place upstairs. Meanwhile a young man who had previously ordered a takeaway had his pasta placed in a paper cup, hence the name of this joint. Ours arrived in paper boxes the long sides of which were about the trice the width of the space to eat their contents upon. Our freshly squeezed orange juices arrived.

Burrito and chips for one from the main menu and from the set lunch, chicken, rice, sundae and coffee, inclusive was the ""free"" salad bar selection. The self-serve salad bar had basic fare, together with a choice of olives. The cucumber, pineapple, beetroot were soggy and appeared to have been standing for some time. None of these was edible, however, the tomatoes and olives were delicious. The burrito was eaten with gusto, but the chips remained in situ.

8851,The George Harvester,209250862,June 2014,"Went to the refurbished George last Sunday evening with family, booked a table and was given a pager / bleeper thing & was told it would flash ,make a noise when our table was ready, I was thinking this is very space age & sure enough it went off about the time the girl at reception said it would ,max brownie points for that. After that it started to go down hill, we were shown our table and waited about 10 mins for the waiter to turn up & take a drinks order first. We ordered a bottle of white wine & a glass of red. When the waiter came back with the drinks which to be fair was quite quick he only bought 2 wine glasses. There were four of us,1 drinking red in a separate glass so we asked for a third Glass to which the waiter replied ,oh I did not think you needed an extra glass as 2 of us were drinking beer , but the biggest shock ( I have been to lots of restaurants & never had this ) he put the bottle of wine on the table unopened and walked off leaving us to open and pour it ourselves. The salad bar seems to have shrunk in choice but was nevertheless still good. When I ordered my mains I specifically told the waiter not to bring a certain item on the plate but guess what it came anyway to which the waiter said oh that's right I forgot to check and the chefs put it on anyway had it not been on a side dish but on the main dish I would of sent the whole lot back . Same sort of thing happened with dessert asked for crumble & custard, when it came he presumed ice cream was ok as they had no custard, maybe if he had come and told us the situation we could of chosen differently but we were not asked. As the evening progressed the service started to get better as it became less busy which I understand as it's a popular place to eat but that does not excuse the level of service from the beginning. Tried the toilets while I was there, they are geared for all age groups which is very good but I found the front door decorated with animal pictures 1step up from mc Donald's , bit like the service,shame really. On leaving my father in law is disabled and found the ramp access very handy but the surrounding ground around the base is on so many different levels it is dangerous and had we not been there he would of fallen over (he was using a wheeled walker) a definite health & safety issue that needs addressing . I will go back to the George as I enjoy it there but on this occasion it did not work for me",3.0

Anyway we were greeted warmly by our waiter and he asked us if we'd been to a Harvester before. Yes we have we told him but he still showed us the salad cart (which hasn't moved) and the new drinks machine. (When we sat down my 12 year old son said that he thought we were going to get a tour of the entire restaurant.) We were given menus and both opted for the mixed grill. Our waiter came over within 5 minutes to take our order and he had an iPhone looking object in his hand. ""Have you seen one of these before?"" He asked. ""No."" I said.

The salad cart is still good more selection for example baby gerkins, olives, couscous and tastes fresh!!

I felt sorry for my waitress who was clearly overworked and did try to sound professional and not harassed but clearly she was. I can understand why they can charge so little for the food when they don't have enough staff. We waited over 20 mins for our drinks (just glasses for the drinks machine) then it took over 50 mins for our meals. Then when the food came i was extremely disappointed by the food portions and quality of the food. I have been to other Harvesters and know what to expect but this one is the worse I have ever been to - despite the new interior - which won't stay nice for long - there was food all over the carpets and floor - not one of the staff tried to clean it up - too busy and overworked I suspect....,2.0

Whilst waiting for my food the Manager dropped a dirty knife on the floor and instead of picking it up he kicked under the table, then the bar man pick up a glass which he started to fill with Coke, but he noticed a dirty mark so poured the drink away and then wiped it with his hand that he had just used to wipe his nose before refilling up again. I did complain to the manager after the meal and I was called on my mobile to basically be told that he would have a word with his member of start about the knife (which although reminding him it was he who did it, still told me he would have a work, I assume with himself).",2.0
8872,The George Harvester,162809002,May 2013,"The place was not inviting outside which should have given us a clue. Inside it was dim and dismal.

The waitress asked it it was OK when she delivered it - we had not tasted it. I will never say yes to that question again. We returned the plates virtually untouched and were not given any apology or discount because she 'had asked us if everything was OK' We paid up and got out as quick as we could.

Ten mins later, no food and it was not easy trying to find a waitress to check on the progress of my food. The rest of my party had already finished, the waitress didn't apologise and went off to find out where the food was. she returned and it plonked it on the table again no apology, the chips were by this time cold as was the chicken which probably had been sitting. No one came to find out if everything was okay after this. The next time we managed to find a waitress it was to clear the table which had all the dirty plates sitting for a while. I asked for the bill and explained that we were in a hurry. She removed some of the plates and then disappeared again for almost 10 mins. I had to ask another waitress to bring the bill.

After discovering that this was simply a stall inside a shopping centre, as opposed to an actual restaurant, my expectations lowered. However, given the number of positive reviews, I expected it to be at least decent for stall food. Unfortunately it didn't manage to even live up to my lowered expectations, with this place being average for stall food at best. There are a whole host of stalls and street food available in London, where you can find significantly better food, so I see little reason to come here. The only edge it really offers is that genuine Italian pasta can be hard to come by from a stall in London.

They had the exact flavour of tortellini I used to have in Italy as a child if not better. Absolutely delicious and in a cup...so funny. I also tried tortellini with red sauce, tiramisu and tigelle with ham. All very yummy. The tiramisu is different and, while excellent, it was not one of the best I had. It was a bit runny for my taste, I prefer more ladyfingers in the mix. I wish they could find a bigger place, maybe close to my work. I would go every day.

So I took his recommendation and ordered a traditional tortellini with cream and mushroom sauce and a vegetarian tortellini with a Bolognese sauce. Also, a lasagne and a couple of tigelle with Parma ham. The portion sizes were just right and I was more than happy with everything. I couldn't help having some vanilla custard balls, these little bite size puffs was just the thing to have after such a satisfying lunch. Ricardo was so chatty and friendly and promised me that the tiramisu is to die for so that means I will definitely have to return to sample it.

Downstairs is more candlelit and they regularly come round to change the candle. Person serving us was excellent, gave a history of how the name came about and stopped us from over-ordering when we got a bit carried away with adding more sides to the main dishes (we went for pies). Food was excellent, portions were more than generous and the fillings in the pie were stuffed to the brim. There was no rushing us, we were left to sit and chat away with our drinks. Great atmosphere and would definitely go back again. For those looking for something different than your normal day to day restaurant the decor alone is a must to visit and the food just tops it off.

We became very hungry and asked a local for any suggestions. He pointed us to Maggie Jones. As we entered, we were warmly greeted by a server. We were taken upstairs to second floor where we were seated in cramped booth. In order to sit down, the table had to be moved to one side so a person can sit, then moved over so others can sit on the other side. The décor had a country/rural feel. Outside was cool, light jacket weather, but it was warm in the restaurant. Our server brought a chalk board menu. My brother selected a meat pie dish, my mother had salmon, and I had chicken breast. We all enjoyed our entrées. We did not order any appetizer or deserts. The service was great.

9120,The George Harvester,449005937,November 2016,Can get crowded in the evenings. The place does need to smarten up or at least look more presentable and hygienic. At times the tables are not cleaned properly and food crumbs are littered on the floor. This is because it is so busy that the staff cannot cope with the flow of customers. The salad bar is a good treat with a great selection of salads and pastas. The bread section is sometimes empty so again someone needs to ensure there is sufficient bread and salad at all times.,4.0

Be warned that some mains require an additional £2 or £1 .....steaks with sauces also have additional cost added. I might have chose the wrong main of smoked bacon belly with sweet potato chips ....the backn was way too salty and even with the chips that didnt help dispel the saltiness ...I mentioned to the waiter , Keke who listened but could not do anything else .i didn't wan to kick up a fuss( I could ) because the bacon was inedible in a way...but my partner's sumptious fish and chips prevented me from taking further action.

There was a prix fixe menu on New Year's eve. My wife started with onion soup and I chose crab cakes. The onion soup was luke warm and a bit bland. The crab cakes were good, but certainly not of a quality that I would beg for their recipe.

With four adults, it was a bit of a tight squeeze but allowed for very easy conversation and did buffer any nearby talking. Two of us shared an order of smoked chicken and artichoke salade which came as advertised--smokey and chokey--delicious way to begin the meal. Two orders of the rabbit and duck pate disappeared quickly followed by satisfied smiles. Mains chosen were chicken and artichoke pie, salmon steak with hollandaise, liver and onions and steak and ale pie. We all tucked in and with accompanying glasses of house red and white wines we spent the next two hours enjoying each others company and the yummy comfort food set before us. Maggie's service is prompt, polite, unobtrusive and accommodating. There is no sense of having to vacate a table too soon, in spite of the full tables across the room (there are three dining rooms in total). To a MJ novice, the decor is difficult to describe but fun to look at and speculate on its origins. Maggie's menu is small but broad enough to satisfy any appetite and the prices are very competitive and perhaps even a tad low for posh Kensington. There is no doubt that a return visit is in the works at this venue hidden away from the hustle and bustle of Kensington Church Street and I would highly recommend Maggie Jones for any type of dining--romantic, group of friends, families and special occasions.",4.0

The turkey lunch was good value and came with stuffing, sausage wrapped in bacon, vegetables, crispy roast potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. There was also a large salad bar where you could help yourself. This was followed by Xmas Pudding and brandy sauce. It was a satisfying meal. Considering that the restaurant was full, service was relatively fast and staff were helpful and pleasant despite being rushed off their feet. Watch out for the car park charges - £1 for 2 hours and £10 for longer.

Initially we were not impressed to be shown to a table at the back which had very badly torn bench seats and a very wobbly table. We moved ourselves to a better location but even here the artificial leather seats were cracked and table unsteady. The place had a makeover in recent years but it has not worn well. Anyway on a more positive note our waitress Rhianne (? Sp) was lovely and all our food excellent. There was a well stocked , clean salad bar and the meat and fries were delicious. We finished with calorific but great tasting sundaes and not a huge bill although shame that early bird is now 2 to 5pm. What really let the place down was the state of the ladies toilets. The floor was dangerously slippery as is common these days with the air hand dryers away from the sinks. 2 of the 3 toilets were full of paper and faeces and one toilet had a broken flush. Customers need to supervise children and report issues but staff had clearly not checked toilets which should be a regular occurrence, no excuse.

Regarding food it was well seasoned food, hot (which is always good and you’ll be surprised how many haven’t been), it was high quality produce and the salad bar is undoubtably the best I’ve seen. Unfortunately and what has dropped my mark would be the service, I had my salad and wait 15 mins for my starter which wasn’t bad and then I sat there and waited and waited and waited, 50 mins went by after my starter was finished and I had to prompt the waitress, she then asked a further 2 members of staff for my food and asked me twice what I had ordered, even after I gave my table number (she could find that info out from that), then I got my food and like I said it was of a good standard and tasted great but I can’t help but be disappointed at the service, yes I was on the bar side but it felt like I was just pushed aside, wether I’m a solo eater or family I’m still a customer.

9222,Portobello Ristorante,481859682,May 2017,"Table for four on a Thursday evening, fairly straightforward for an Italian restaurant in Portobello, right? Wrong. Tables are crammed together meaning if like me you were unlucky enough to be on the aisle, you'd get bashed about 20 times during a two course meal. If people on a table next to you need to get up, everyone has to move around to let them out. There are insufficient staff so wait times to order are long - we were there for 20 minutes before being given a menu. The wine list is okay but we had to opt for our third choice red before finding one they had in the cellar: it's really easy to maintain a list, you just put a pencil line through out of stock labels and rub it out when/if you restock; better still, keep a reasonable stock? The white arrived at room temperature and although an ice bucket was provided on request the impact only got going towards the end of the bottle. Really, this is basic stuff. The food came without too much delay but the waitress attempted to clear crockery before everyone had finished - more than once - so some staff training definitely missing. There was no personality: everyone was complacent/disinterested: no-one came to check on us: no smiles, no engagement from the waitress: and boy is it noisy - over cramped and no soft furnishings to absorb any sound. I was really uncomfortable on a chair that needed restringing and frankly I was pleased to leave. Don't get me wrong: the food is good (not great) but I could not recommend the destination.",1.0

9255,Coda Restaurant by Eric Chavot,733553306,December 2019,"We went to the Coda Restaurant before a showing of Handel’s Messiah. Immediately we were greeted in a very welcoming way by maitre d' Simona. We arrived a little early but she took us straight to our seats. The decor of the restaurant was so beautiful. We were introduced to our waiter and offered drinks immediately. They arrived quickly. We were then offered the menu, it was truly hard to choose what to have as everything looked so delicious. We chose our food and soon after were offered delicious warm freshly made bread. The food, all of it, was absolutely exquisite and I genuinely mean that. The ambience was so lovely in there too. I must say Simona’s attention to detail and willingness to answer any questions was incredible. One moment I thought was very telling of her attention to detail was when she arrived at our table with a fresh napkin. I told her I already had one, as I looked down on my lap, but it had actually fallen on the floor without me noticing. She discreetly replaced my napkin on my lap with the new one and removed the one off the floor. I don’t know how she even noticed because it hadn’t fallen in an obvious place. She runs that restaurant like clockwork and made the evening extra special before we’d even got to the performance, which was incredible. 5 stars to Simona, the staff and to the Chef.",5.0

A business visit took my work colleague and I into close proximity so where better to enjoy a delclious Italian meal again and a traditional trattoria? Other than an occasions lick of paint, I doubt that Benito's has changed in the 30+ years during which I have dined there. My colleague chose the calamari and a starter. I chose the onion soup. Both were delicious! To the mains! My colleague, the lemon sole served with rice as opposed to sauté potatoes or mash. I opted for the canneloni. Again, both dishes served piping hot and an absolute treat. My colleague chose Peroni whilst i washed it all down with a half bottle of the very acceptable house red. An amaretto and a French coffee rounded off lunch for both of us. We don't get to visit Benito's as often as we'd like but a return visit is on the cards! Hugely recommended!",5.0

9374,Steak & Co. Gloucester Road Kensington,716518817,September 2019,"You order a steak like sirloin, rib eye or mignon and you get it served medium rare with nice grillmarks. When you order the steak you can decide between several flavored butter, flavored salts and souces, as example garlic butter, smoked paprika chili salt and sauce bernaise. On a hot stone you melt the butter, cut your steak, if you want it grilled in „tagliatta“ slices or let it on the whole and grill it to the point you like. Dont forget to flavour with the salt. By side you can get baked onions, french fries, chips, vegetables or salads. A useful help is the attentive waitress Eszther, which explains you the approach and also served two different mustards, when we asked for a mustard.The house wine, a shiraz corresponds nice to the steaks. The only recomandation was, that now in brexit times the french chips must not be eu conform yellow, instead of that they could be crispy brown, the bernaise was a little bit thin, could have more butter in it and the chilipowder in the salt was not as spicy as expected.

Our first visit was on a busy Saturday night and we had no reservations. But she squeezed us in. Second night, two of us decided to go again and found you couldn't do online reservations the same day after 1600 so decided to try again. Success again. Monday we made reservations to make Anya happy as much as anything, and we got a table a little out of the bustle. But we had excellent meals and bitter/lager all three nights.

9416,Steak & Co. Gloucester Road Kensington,709027919,September 2019,"We visited the Kensington branch on a Wednesday early evening, and it was already busy. It's convenient for Gloucester Road tube, and staffed by friendly people. There's a *lot* of small tables in a relatively small area, and not a lot of soft furnishings, so it's noisy. Then there's the musak to contend with. Because of these things, you raise your voice to be heard over the noise of everyone else raising their voices; not so good when meeting friends after a decade apart. The steaks are Argentinian, and excellent. You get a lightly seared lump of whichever cut you ordered, a small and very hot slab of marble, and your choice of seasoned salt, butter and sauce. You then cut your steak however you wish and then cook on the slab to your liking. 5-10 minutes later, the side dishes appear. There's the problem; do you wait for your meal(in which case the slab cools down), or do you press on and eat in stages? They don't have control of the timing at all, and the noise meant that one side was wrongly ordered, and delivered far too late to do anything about.

I ordered a filet and my companion a strip steak, both of which were high quality Steak is seared and served next to a blazing hot stone on which you will finish the cooking to your exact taste. It was like having a hibachi for one. Seasoned butter and salts to cook with and a nice mushroom sauce for dipping greatly enhanced the taste. Our waitress was a pleasure: so helpful and friendly.

Home made yorkshires, decent roast potatoes, cauliflower cheese, swede, red cabbage possibly being the one thing some people might not fancy, but I thought a nice selection. Not huge portions but enough. Dessert was better still, posset with homemade shortbread biscuits, really light. A good selection of beers, too, I had a nice pale ale. £18 for the beef, £16 or so for the chicken, £6 something for dessert. Slightly more than some of the other places we looked at but worth it I think. Staff were really nice and friendly too. I'd come here again if staying in Kensington again.",4.0

Since we were only two, and I guess we seemed like nice people, he said we could take on of the tables, but that like Cinderella, at the time of the reservation we would need to go.

Had time to enjoy a local pint, the Tomato and Roasted Garlic Soup, and the Lamb Chops with Eggplant and Feta. Both dishes were excellent. My wife had the Cottage Pie, which she liked.

9480,Bistro Benito,567652801,March 2018,"My last visit to Bistro Benito was in 2015. As a former regular diner in the 80s and 90s, only a change of area reduced my visits to this always dependable restaurant. A visit to Olympia gave me the opportunity to return for a very welcome lunch. The restaurant tends to be quiet during weekday lunches and provides a calm oasis from the roar of Earls Court Road traffic just outside. As ever, service was prompt and very friendly. With a Peroni and a very acceptable half bottle of the delicious house red, our starters arrived. Escargot for my companion with my choice of asparagus, both served in a butter sauce and both delicious. My companion mopped up every drop of his butter sauce with the freshly cut crusty bread. To the mains! I opted for calf’s liver, based on my many past visits and on seizing the opportunity to savour this rapidly disappearing delicacy due, I would imagine, to its relentlessly escalating cost. A perfectly 'pink' and very generous 4 slices arrived, with sides of cauliflower cheese and sauté potatoes. My companion ordered his favourite spaghetti vongole - perfectly cooked al dente spaghetti, plentiful clams, all in a light sauce. 'Superb!'. We skipped desserts, opting for coffees to round off a delicious and warming lunch. A delicious central London lunch time dining experience coming in at under £60! Benito himself is a friendly, gregarious chap with a friendly smile and a warm welcome that has not diminished over my 40 years of patronage. Whilst lunch times are 'light' in terms of diners, do book for weekends as, from memory, Benito's is rammed, a view underscored by the many covers, always a good sign of a busy restaurant.

Again a good plateful and following a chat with the owner regarding some southern Italians enjoying chill oil on their spaghetti carbonara I tried it and was very pleasantly surprised!

9506,The Hereford Arms,631699878,August 2018,"We flew to London to celebrate my wife's milestone birthday. Her request to have great fish and chips led to much research on my part and, after reading many reviews of many places, the Hereford Arms seemed to fit the bill. It did. Perfectly. While I was also researching a place to have our big birthday celebration meal (ultimately, at Core by Clare Smyth), I came across an article that spoke about how London eating choices were no longer limited to the usual fish and chips, mutton, or shepherd's pie...which is very, very true. Ironically, at Hereford Arms, my wife had the fish and chips and I had lamb chops (mutton...), however, both raised this ""typical British fare"" to new levels of complexity, tenderness, and savory goodness. I would agree with our friendly and very knowledgeable waiter, that the fish and chips were the best in London, save, perhaps, the ones prepared by his mum... Absolutely delicious, crisp batter, succulent fish...and the usual afterthought of the small side of smashed peas was remarkably delicious. Likewise, my lamb chops were grilled to perfection, with just the right bit of char/sear on the outside, wonderfully medium rare on the inside and tender as could be. Again, the vegetable, a seemingly simple slice of eggplant beneath the chop, was perfectly grilled, so that the sweetness of the carmelization from the char was the leading flavor, followed by a host of subtle, complex delights. Our appetizer of a scotch egg in black pudding was also delightfully delicious and perfectly prepared. Just couldn't ask for more from ""pub food"" whose execution was more at a fine-dining level. And prices were very reasonable for such quality. The place was very busy, so reservations highly recommended. Atmosphere was lively, maybe leaning towards loud, but we were able to carry on a conversation without raising our voices.",5.0

It was a bit taken aback when I tried to order a side dish along with my main, and he rather sharply interrupted me and said that he would take all the main dishes first and then the vegetables. Maybe it was because we were quite a large group and this made his life easier, so we went along with it. As for the food itself, I had whitebait as a starter, which was disappointing as they were soft and not crispy and crunchy as they should be. However, my sea bass (served complete with head and tail) with sauté potatoes and cauliflower gratin was excellent, as were the profiteroles. I had the house red, which turned out to be Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, very nice. We weren't offered bread, but did get a limoncello each on the house as a digestivo.

They weren’t too big, and they weren’t too skinny. They were, for me, just right!

From the outside it looks like a traditional pub with locals having a pint on the terrace. Inside it has the vibe of local restaurant with a casual yet stylish flair, filled with locals and visitors. The first night (we actually returned on our last night) we had the fish and chips, which was delicate and flavourful. The last evening of our stay we had lamb and poultry with interesting marinades and side dishes (Mac and cheese to die for). Everything is made in-house and it shows!

9626,The Hereford Arms,594055434,July 2018,"Visited the Hereford Arms today for Sunday Lunch around 3pm. Service quite quick. We both had the beef Sunday Roast which looked great but both dinners were cold...really cold. So we sent them back with no fuss by us or the staff. Second dinners came quite quickly. I was ready to tuck in but noticed the vegetables were tiny portions to say the least. I had about a teaspoon of cabbage and just one tiny floret of cauliflower Cheselbourne about the size of a raspberry. I called the waitress and pointed this out and she agreed it was a tiny portion and said she was sorry and would bring out some side portion. As this was happening my partner tucked into his cauliflower cheese which was very cold but as we were having free sides he didn't complain. Two sides of cauliflower and one side of cabbage arrived. We had by now ate most of the meat (which although very tepid was in fact very tasty) so started on the vegetables which were fridge temperature cold. I again called over the waitress ...she and a waiter had both confirmed that the food we had and the food we had before was in cold so it wasn't us being overly fussy. We were offered hot replacement sides which we accepted but by the time they came piping hot but we had almost finished the meal. I said we weren't happy and would expect a discount. The Manageress came over who had said that she had spoken to her Manager who said we couldnt have a discount but could have a free pudding but we didn't fancy pudding so hadon't to pay full price. The price of the Sunday roast is a whopping £19 each. I would expect much better, hot food for this price. We paid but will never return. Had we have had money off our bill I would maybe have given it another try as I appreciate that there are ""off"" days but not to have had a discount on food we complained about 3 times is not looking after the customer. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I have given 1 star only because you have to put at least one in to post review.",1.0

We opted for a couple of sharing plates (Okay) then smoked duck salad (all rice no salad - poor), fish cakes (okay), burger (okay), fish & chips (okay) and pheasant (very good). We had a bottle of Nautilus Estate Pinot Noir, NZ (very poor) which doesn’t seem to be available at any retailer in the UK so probably only available in the pub trade. We finished with a crumble (Good), ice cream (Okay) and Sticky Toffee (Okay). Overall nice pub. Service was good as was the beer. Packed with good atmosphere. Food far from gastropub status but then inexpensive and not up to the standards of Ladbroke Arms or The Phene. So I would recommend going for a beer maybe with a few bar snacks but they need a proper wine list and to up their game significantly with the food.",3.0

With old dusty brasses and painted on beams?? no olives, bread etc... offered. Italians pride themselvews on multiple courses. not here. On to starters. I had king prawns in tomato and chilli. Prawns were small, the tomato sauce was like cheap tomato soup and there was no chilli whatsoever. yuck. My friend had asparagus. 4 tired looking stalks in a bath of butter, NO shaved parmesan or fresh ground pepper. i can't remember what tripe the rest of the party had to start. The wine list was just as bad, no Soave, no Barolo??! seriously what Italian restaurant doesn't have Barolo?? I was too scared to have any other main apart from spaghetti bolognese which was another awful affair. the only redeeming factor was the spaghetti was cooked al dente like it should be.

9840,Bistro Benito,265744564,April 2015,Ate here tonight with a colleague when our first choice restaurant was full. The place was sparsely occupied but it turned out that the majority of those dining were Italians and also include the owner Benitto who interrupted his own meal to welcome us and checked regularly that our food was ok. The prices were cheap by any standards let alone central London and the fillet steak I ordered from the specials menu for £16 was as large as any I have had anywhere and cooked to medium rare perfection. The house red was very palatable esp at just over £12 a bottle and my colleague said his mussels were very good. The garlic bread was the only slight let down with just 2 small slices of French bread toasted with garlic. I will definitely return next time I am in the area.,4.0

As if that was not enough, we also had our first taste of the Eaton Mess and the Ale and Molasses Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert -- double yum.

You cook the steak to your own requirements at the table on a hot plate lubricated with a little self-applied butter (presumably so the meat does not stick to the metal). All very nice until the butter goes on burning away after you lift the sliice of meat up and the restaurant becomes a fog of black smoke and the diners at half the tables are coughing for dear life (more than one person will always be putting too much on the hot plate). Fortunately i have a balcony at home and by morning the stink had dissipated from trousers shirt and jacket hung ourside overnight but this may not be an option for everyone.,3.0

9929,Bistro Benito,201150157,April 2014,The food was very well cooked although the portions were slightly smaller than other Italian restaurants I have been to. Waiter was very friendly and the service was excellent. The decor is stereotypical of a 1970s Italian restaurant but that added to the charm of the place. As it was a Saturday night it was quite crowded and the tables were very close together. Not ideal if you are on a romantic night out but fine for casual family dining.

9958,Bistro Benito,198237723,March 2014,"Being in Earls Court for a business meeting, a colleague and I chose to have lunch at Bistro Benito, an old style Italian restaurant at the Cromwell Road end of Earls Court Road and a quiet refuge from the noise and bustle. I had been a regular diner at this restaurant in the 80s so this was a welcome and long overdue return after 30 years ....... and nothing had changed! If you are looking for smart décor, modern lighting, designer tables and chairs, go elsewhere as some of Benito's more critical reviewers should have done in the first place! This is not, by any means, fine dining. This is a solid, traditional, family-run restaurant serving good, dependable and very tasty Italian food. We were greeted by the owner, Benito, who had lost as much weight since my last visit as I had gained in that time! His welcome was as warm as ever and it seemed as though the years had not dimmed our memory of each other. My co-diner started with fried mushrooms to my asparagus, both cooked simply and perfectly. We moved on to spaghetti alle vongole, a particular favourite of my usually critical co-diner and my calves liver, a rapidly disappearing option on many menus due to the cost, I imagine, cooked rare, as requested, to melt in the mouth perfection. We skipped dessert and opted for espresso and tea to round off the meal. Peroni and a half bottle of the very acceptable house red were both modestly priced for Central London and, with a complimentary limoncello, brought the bill to under £50 for a very enjoyable lunch. A thoroughly enjoyable hour, delicious wholesome food and a reunion with an old friend. We'll be back .... and we won't leave it for another 30 years!",5.0

It was actually nice to be seated there, since our table was next to the open sliding door (toward the back on the left), allowing us to enjoy a bit of a cool breeze. We ordered some spaghetti bolognaise, chicken with mushoom, and lamb shank, and mixed salads for all. In general, the meals were all quite good. The lamb shank was probably our least favorite -- although succulent and tender, it was smothered in a *very* heavy and salty mushroom brown sauce.

I was puzzled at their menu because not much was Italian - my meal was French and bad French at that! My husband had calves liver and bacon and the bacon came up a peculiar white colour so he didn't eat it and his was also lukewarm. His starter wasn't very exciting, we only had 2 glasses of house wine each and the bill was over £50 - a better meal in the Little French Restaurant would have been about £38.

From the outside it looked like a nice, family run restaurant and although it felt a little cramped inside we had high hopes. These ended quickly when the waiter seemed totally uninterested in explaining the menu to us to the point of being rude. When my wife asked about one dish he simply said 'I eat it every day' with no interest on his face at all and no attempt to explain the contents of the dish, which is what she asked. The few staff we saw looked miserable. A gent that appeared to be the owner offered us a dessert menu and rudely snatched the menus back when we declined. We waited an eternity for the bill to arrive and had to ask three times for it - the last attempt involving us having to leave our seats and hunt the waitress down for it. I am giving it 2 stars purely on the basis that my main course was quite good, although a little oily, however my wife said her pasta dish was bland and tasteless. In fairness the prices were good value but the food has to be good as well and a 50% success rate (my dish) isn't enough. I'm sorry to say that I can not recommend this restaurant based on our experience.",2.0
